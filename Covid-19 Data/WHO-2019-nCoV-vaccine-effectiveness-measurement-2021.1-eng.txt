Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

Key messages
This document provides interim best practice guidance on how to assess COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness
(VE) using observational study designs. It discusses critical considerations in the design, analysis and
interpretation of COVID-19 VE evaluations, as biased results may be produced even in settings where
data completeness and quality are high. This guidance is targeted mostly for evaluations undertaken in
low- and middle-income countries (L/MICs), but most of the concepts apply to VE evaluations in highincome settings as well.
Key messages in this document:
Due to their methodological complexity and susceptibility to biases, COVID-19 VE evaluations do not
need to be conducted by all countries introducing COVID-19 vaccines. A checklist of criteria to have
in place when considering such evaluations is provided.
Objectives of VE evaluations are to evaluate real-world performance of vaccines, to address gaps
in evidence from clinical trials (including effectiveness in subgroups, effectiveness against variants
of concern and duration of protection), to provide input into impact models, and to provide postauthorization confirmation of effectiveness of conditionally approved products.
The most feasible outcomes to evaluate in VE evaluations in most settings are symptomatic disease and
severe disease. VE studies of death, infection and transmission, while of great public health importance,
generally require targeted special studies with more resources.
We recommend the use of laboratory-confirmed outcomes in VE evaluations. At this time, we
recommend the use of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for
laboratory testing of participants. Specimens should be taken within 10 days of disease onset.
We recommend against the use of self-reported COVID-19 vaccination as the sole source indicating
whether a person is vaccinated, due to recall bias and lack of product details. Documented vaccination
should be used for the primary analysis; self-reported vaccination could be included in a secondary
analysis.
Although not without potential biases, we recommend the test-negative design as the most efficient
and logistically feasible method to assess VE in L/MICs, with the advantage of some degree of
comparability between cases and controls since they all sought care for a similar illness at the same
facilities. Other methods that could be considered are cohort studies, case-control studies, and the
screening method (in certain settings with reliable information on coverage at different times during
the study period).
Due to lack of randomization of vaccination in real-world settings, all observational study designs are
subject to bias because vaccinated persons often differ from unvaccinated persons in their disease
risk, independent of vaccination. Important biases include the following: confounding by health care
seeking or exposure risk, misclassification of outcomes due to diagnostic errors, prior SARS-CoV-2
infection, and spurious inferences of waning. Collection of key covariates to control for confounding
bias in the analysis is important.

Key messages

vii

For the primary analysis of VE studies, a conservative approach is recommended in considering a person
as potentially protected from vaccination only from 14 days after the date of first dose of vaccination
(the time required to achieve protection for the majority of vaccine recipients for most vaccines), and
7–14 days after second doses of vaccine (if applicable).
The primary analysis should compare persons receiving the recommended number of doses of the
same vaccine with unvaccinated individuals. Secondary analyses include partially vaccinated persons,
persons receiving doses of two different vaccines, targeted subgroups, viral variants, and history of prior
SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease if available. Even though partial vaccination and the use of different
vaccines to complete a course are not currently recommended by WHO, these might happen in the
real world and findings could inform future policy.
VE estimates that vary from efficacy in clinical trials could be valid or not valid; thorough investigation
into reasons for the difference should be undertaken.
Existing platforms that can be used for VE evaluations include surveillance systems for severe acute
respiratory infections (SARI), influenza-like illness (ILI), other syndromic disease surveillance in sentinel
hospitals, health worker surveillance, administrative databases and well-defined outbreaks.
We recommend standardized reporting of the results of studies based on the Strengthening the
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidance, as well as suggested additional
COVID-19 specific elements described below.

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of this guide and target audience
Since its emergence in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), has taken a tremendous toll globally; by 28 February 2021, there have been over 110 million
cases and 2.5 million deaths worldwide from COVID-19 (1). Although most COVID-19 deaths occur among
older adults and persons with chronic comorbid medical conditions, deaths have occurred in persons of
all ages. Moreover, the pandemic has caused widespread morbidity and necessitated control measures
that have devastated economies worldwide. In response to the pandemic, the global efforts to develop
multiple vaccines to protect against COVID-19 disease have been unrivalled in the history of public health.
By the end of 2020, three COVID-19 vaccines have received Emergency Use Approval/Listing (EUA/EUL)
by maturity level 4 regulatory authorities, based on reaching predefined criteria for safety and efficacy,
and at least several dozen more are in clinical trials (2).
From December 2020, vaccines started to be rolled out according to various allocation plans, which differ
by country. Generally, these are based on criteria of risk of serious disease and death, ethical principles
of fairness and equity, and considerations for restarting stalled economies (3, 4). As vaccine production
capacity scales up and new products are authorized, allocation criteria will broaden until supply enables
widespread use of vaccines.
During the initial implementation phases, as for every new vaccine, post-introduction evaluations will be
important to address many of the remaining questions about the performance of these vaccines. When
a vaccine is used outside trial populations the effects of the vaccine may differ in specific geographies or
subpopulations. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) might be different against various disease outcomes, against
infection and infectiousness, and against newly emerging virus variant strains. Additionally, important
programmatic issues will need to be addressed, such as the effectiveness of incomplete dose schedules,
variation in dose intervals, and the interchangeability of different vaccine products. Suboptimal cold
chain capacity, and off-schedule and incomplete delivery of doses could lead to different vaccine
performance. Vaccines might not be as effective against new variants. Finally, assessing the duration of
vaccine protection requires longer term studies. This document offers best practice guidance in how to
undertake post-introduction evaluations of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.
Most clinical trial results are likely to be from high- and middle-income country populations and assessing
effectiveness in representative low- and lower middle-income countries (L/MICs) will be particularly
important. This document emphasizes approaches deemed most feasible in L/MICs.
This guidance for undertaking VE evaluations for COVID-19 vaccines follows, in many aspects, previous
World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on how to evaluate VE in observational studies, including
for vaccines against rotavirus, influenza and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcus
(5–7). Because of its similarity in clinical presentation and epidemiology, this guidance document draws
heavily on the influenza VE guidance. Nonetheless, several distinct features of COVID-19 epidemiology
and vaccines create unique challenges and approaches to evaluation.
This guidance is written primarily for investigators and public health practitioners who will design and
undertake observational COVID-19 VE evaluations and for policy-makers who will interpret and apply the

results of these evaluations. The document discusses critical considerations in the design, analysis and
interpretation of COVID-19 VE evaluations, as biased results may be produced even in settings where data
completeness and quality are high. These recommendations also aim to ensure a level of comparability
and completeness of reporting on studies that will enable comparability between studies.
Importantly, we do not recommend that COVID-19 VE evaluations be conducted by all countries
introducing COVID-19 vaccines. VE evaluations will likely be conducted by a number of countries
worldwide, for a variety of different vaccines, and the results can be expected to be applicable to other
countries in the same region with similar populations, COVID-19 epidemiology and immunization systems.
The decision to carry out VE evaluations should be based on the need for country- or region-specific VE
estimates to guide vaccine policy and on capacity to conduct rigorous VE evaluations that will minimize
biases and optimize the likelihood of accurate results.

1.2 Epidemiology of COVID-19
COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. WHO declared a public health emergency
of international concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Knowledge about
transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative virus, is continuously evolving as new evidence
accumulates. According to available evidence, SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads between people when an
infected person is in close contact with another person (8,9). The estimated incubation period (from
infection to onset of first symptoms) is between 2 and 14 days with a median of 5 days. Importantly,
infection may also be asymptomatic but still be transmissible (10–12).
A wide range of symptoms for COVID-19 has been reported, the most common being acute onset of fever,
chills, cough and shortness of breath. Loss of smell or taste are symptoms that seem to be more common
than with other viral respiratory infections. The majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are either asymptomatic
or result in mild disease. Some persons will develop post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (also known as
“long COVID-19”). Data from several countries suggest that 14%–19% of ill persons are hospitalized, and
3%–5% will develop severe disease that requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission for complications
(13–15). Radiologic findings, consisting mostly of ground-glass patterns in the lung parenchyma, have
been found even among mildly symptomatic persons. Older age, particularly > 60 years, is the strongest
risk factor for severe disease and death (16–18). Underlying noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes,
hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic lung disease and cancer, are also risk factors for severe disease and
death (16, 19–22). Some racial groups, morbidly obese persons and pregnant women also have elevated
risk for severe disease (23–26).
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are generally milder in children than in adults. However, a rare acute
presentation with a hyperinflammatory syndrome leading to multiorgan failure and shock temporally
associated with COVID-19 has been described as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (27).

1.3 COVID-19 vaccine landscape, regulatory status and policy considerations
With unprecedented speed, by the end of 2020, over 200 vaccine candidates on various platforms
were in development, of which 14 are in late clinical stage development, and three have received EUA/
EUL by maturity level 4 regulatory authorities and have started to be rolled out in multiple countries.
Additional vaccines have received national regulatory approval and are in use in a few countries, some in
advance of the results of efficacy trials (2). Many countries have set up bilateral agreements with multiple
manufacturers to procure COVID-19 vaccines (28). However, most L/MICs have relied on the COVAX Global
2

Vaccine Facility, which is co-led by WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI)
and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (29). Within the COVAX Facility, resources secure the R&D of its vaccine
portfolio and pooled demand for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all participating countries.
Through the COVAX Facility, countries will receive vaccine allocations proportional to their population
size which will be deployed according to national allocation frameworks (30).
All COVID-19 vaccines for in-country use will need to be authorized by national regulatory authorities.
Most of the early approvals for use are likely to be based on interim results of efficacy trials, leading to
EUA/EUL or conditional approval. EUA/EUL is not licensure, and formal licensure must still be obtained
for these vaccines. After EUA/EUL by regulatory authorities, COVID-19 vaccines can be submitted to
WHO’s vaccine prequalification programme. WHO also has an EUL mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines
(31). Approved vaccines for purchase through the COVAX Facility require WHO prequalification, or the
EUA/EUL of a maturity level 4 regulatory authority (e.g. the United States Food & Drug Administration,
European Medicines Agency).
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) advises WHO on vaccine policy. SAGE
reviews evidence from the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and provides product-specific recommendations,
particularly with respect to use of vaccines in L/MICs. Of note, not all COVID-19 vaccines will be submitted
for WHO prequalification, be recommended for use by SAGE, nor be procured through the COVAX Facility.
Some vaccines might be used in countries through bilateral arrangements with manufacturers. It is
important that these vaccines also be evaluated by well executed post-introduction VE evaluations in
settings in which they are rolled out.

1.4 Suggested criteria to undertake VE evaluations of COVID-19 vaccines
VE evaluations require significant planning, technical expertise, resources and time. The following are
criteria suggested to be in place to conduct a high-quality VE evaluation:
Clear public health rationale for conducting the VE evaluation in terms of informing policy decisions
in country, region or globally. Participation of ministries of health in VE evaluation is encouraged to
facilitate use of the data to guide policy.
Experienced epidemiologic team to develop the protocol, execute evaluation in the field, assess
biases, analyse the data and interpret the results. Consultation of technical partners with experience
in VE studies is recommended.
Dedicated staffing, including experienced field team, to enrol participants by rigorously applying
screening case definitions and ensure any necessary testing, to complete questionnaires and conduct
follow-up, as needed for some study designs; personnel at each enrolment site will likely be needed.
Other key staff include supervisors, data specialists and administrative support.
Identified sites of enrolment: existing surveillance platforms are an advantage but are not a necessary
prerequisite for conducting studies. However, if new surveillance platforms are set up, this will take
time to establish. Electronic medical record databases might also be used if available.
Availability of reliable diagnostic tests in the study population, preferably real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, with ideally a sensitivity ≥ 85% and specificity
≥ 98%. Testing should be free of charge to potential participants in VE evaluations.

Ability to ascertain accurately the vaccination status of participants usually through electronic or
paper records.
Data collection, management and analytic capacity in place: statistician and appropriately trained
epidemiologist involvement are crucial. Understanding potential sources of bias and having the ability
to accurately capture data on potential confounding variables are needed.
Ability to enrol enough participants to achieve the required sample size needed. The time to
complete VE evaluations depends on many variables (e.g. outcomes, design, incidence), but usually
requires several months at a minimum.
Data dissemination plan in place: willingness to report results using standardized criteria and/or
share results or data for multisite analyses.
Funding secured to conduct rigorous evaluation: costs will vary depending on country costs,
existence of platforms that can be leveraged, study design, and sample size. Funding may be needed
for additional staffing, lab collection and testing supplies, transport, or data management equipment.
Functional ethical review committee to review protocol expeditiously, if deemed necessary according
to local research determination.

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

2. The role of VE and impact studies for
COVID-19 vaccines
2.1 The role of VE studies in evaluating COVID-19 vaccines
While the decision to introduce proven effective COVID-19 vaccines might not be in doubt for most
countries due to the disease’s high public health and economic burden worldwide, understanding these
vaccines’ effectiveness in real-world settings will still be essential post-introduction. The Phase III clinical
trials will not answer all of the questions of the performance of these vaccines. Most of the trials are using
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 as their primary endpoint. Due to the current high incidence, many trials will
achieve (or have already achieved) the primary objective after a few months and manufacturers will then
apply to regulators for EUA/EUL. When the EUA/EUL is approved, these vaccines will become available
quickly since manufacturing has already begun, as has been observed with the first few vaccines. Many
placebo recipients in these clinical trials will likely receive active vaccine before the end of the trial, thereby
limiting the ability to achieve the statistical power to evaluate many of the secondary outcomes. Some of
these secondary outcomes will be critical for policy-makers, such as the efficacy against severe COVID-19
and death, the duration of protection, and risk factors for vaccine failure. Moreover, to date, the trials did
not target enrolment of some groups that might be vaccinated, such as pregnant women.
In the future, COVID-19 vaccines might be conditionally authorized for use based on immunogenicity
data, if this is thought to be a likely surrogate measure of efficacy, and such vaccines will require postauthorization evidence of VE against disease. Key questions to be answered about COVID-19 vaccines will
likely only be answered through observational studies of VE after they are introduced (Box 1).

2.2 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness versus impact
BOX 2. M EA S URE S OF VA C C IN E P ERFO R M A N C E
Vaccine efficacy: reduced risk of infection or disease among vaccinated individuals resulting from
vaccination in carefully controlled circumstances; estimated from randomized clinical trials.
Vaccine effectiveness: reduced risk of infection or disease among vaccinated individuals attributed to
vaccination in real-world conditions; estimated from observational (non-randomized) studies.
Vaccine impact: reduction in incidence of infection or disease in a population where some members are
vaccinated. Vaccine impact depends upon vaccine coverage and results from direct effects of vaccination
in the vaccinated, as well as any indirect effects in the vaccinated and unvaccinated due to herd protection
(32, 33). Impact can also pertain to other measures besides disease, such as health systems’ functioning
and capacity and economic indicators.

Evaluations of how vaccines work in a population typically consider three parameters – efficacy,
effectiveness and impact (Box 2). Efficacy is often estimated in pre-licensure clinical trials. This guidance
document will focus mostly on real-world VE. However, a brief description of COVID-19 vaccine impact
is warranted, as the reduction in the overall incidence of disease in the population due to a vaccination
programme gives a key measure of the effect on public health. The impact of vaccination programmes on
disease burden is typically evaluated using surveillance systems that compare the incidence of disease
before and after vaccine implementation. For certain vaccines, these assessments can include both the
incidence of laboratory-confirmed outcomes, such as invasive S. pneumoniae or rotavirus disease, and of
non-specific outcomes, such as hospitalizations and/or deaths from pneumonia or diarrhoea, with the
difference in incidence attributed to the vaccination programme. These pre-post impact studies, often
applying interrupted time-series methods to surveillance data, can show the degree to which introduction
of the vaccine has reduced disease incidence (34). Pre-post impact studies, however, are most suitable
for endemic diseases with fairly consistent year-to-year epidemiology, such as Hib, pneumococcus and
rotavirus. When disease rates and severity vary substantially year to year, such as with influenza, pre-post
impact studies are usually difficult to interpret. In the case of COVID-19, there will be little more than
1 year of baseline incidence data in the pre-vaccine period in most places. Moreover, the spread of SARSCoV-2 has been variable, impacted by different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) over time and
geographical areas, with peaks and troughs of disease that vary both temporally and spatially, precluding
pre-post impact evaluations in most settings. Additionally, care seeking and COVID-19 diagnostic patterns
might change after vaccines are rolled out, as has been seen with other vaccine introductions. For these
reasons, formal pre-post impact studies, such as interrupted time series, are likely to be challenging for
COVID-19 vaccines. If pre-post impact studies are undertaken, measures to assess temporal trends would
be important. For example, investigators could make a comparison of contemporaneous changes in
COVID-19 rates between groups or areas targeted for vaccines and groups not targeted, or assess changes
in testing rates or percentage positive among tested persons after vaccine introduction (35). Nonetheless,
in many settings, such studies will be very difficult to interpret, unless there are clearly evident reductions
in incidence coincident with vaccine introduction.
Vaccine impact could also be assessed by a phased introduction of vaccine by geographic area (e.g.
stepped wedge design), which might allow for contemporaneous assessment of the reduction in incidence
due to widespread vaccination. This might be an attractive approach in the setting of limited supply of
vaccine. Limitations to this approach include variable COVID-19 epidemiology in different geographies
6

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

and rapid vaccine rollout leaving an insufficient amount of time to evaluate rates between vaccinated
and unvaccinated areas. Moreover, it could be politically unpalatable, unethical, impractical or counterproductive to delay vaccination in certain areas.
Apart from rigorously designed special studies, we do not recommend undertaking vaccine
impact studies in most L/MIC settings, especially in short time intervals after vaccine introduction.
Interpretation of pre-post impact data should be done with caution.

2. The role of VE and impact studies for COVID-19 vaccines

3. Outcomes of interest for VE evaluations
For COVID-19 VE evaluations, several major outcomes of interest can be considered.

3.1 COVID-19 deaths
The burden of COVID-19 mortality has been devastating, with 1.7 million deaths occurring in the first
year of the pandemic and the number still increasing rapidly (1). Preventing COVID-19 deaths has been
one of the principles that has guided recommendations for early COVID-19 vaccine allocation, though
none of the controlled trials have been large enough to evaluate efficacy against this endpoint. Therefore,
measuring VE against COVID-19 deaths would have very high public health relevance.
VE evaluations of COVID-19 deaths, however, are challenging methodologically. First, many people
who have died from COVID-19 have not undergone diagnostic testing, making it difficult to distinguish
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 deaths. This might be particularly the case in L/MIC settings, when many
cases may not seek hospital care before dying. Attempts to identify COVID-19 deaths retrospectively
using verbal autopsy are likely to be inaccurate due to the lack of specificity in defining COVID-19 based
on symptoms and signs. Second, it will be difficult to accumulate enough confirmed COVID-19 deaths
in a study site, since the incidence of COVID-19 mortality remains relatively low, especially in some
L/MIC settings where there are fewer older adults (36). Third, obtaining accurate vaccination status for
deceased people may be difficult in most L/MICs. Because of these concerns, in most settings, we do
not recommend VE evaluations where the primary outcome is only COVID-19 mortality.
Importantly, however, deaths are a subset of those with severe disease (see Section 3.2 Severe COVID-19
disease( )) . In some settings, some assessment of vaccine impact on COVID-19 deaths might be possible.
Some settings might have large enough administrative databases (e.g. health maintenance organizations
[HMOs], electronic health records in large hospitals) with standardized cause of death determinations
and vaccine status that a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 VE against death could be possible. If highly
effective vaccines become available in a short period of time with high coverage among high-risk groups,
a reduction in excess mortality ascribed to COVID-19 might reflect a large vaccine impact (though will
not necessarily estimate VE) (37).

3.2 Severe COVID-19 disease
Severe disease is an outcome of public health and policy setting relevance as it is a precursor to death,
can result in long-term morbidity, and has substantial repercussions on health care systems. Confirming
severe COVID-19 disease is likely achievable in many settings. Hospitalization can serve as a reasonable
minimal criterion for severity in most settings, which will allow for logistical efficiency in capturing severe
cases. Yet, health care utilization and thresholds for hospitalization can vary by geographic location and
individual hospital, leading to variability of severity among hospitalized cases. Therefore, hospitalization
alone should not be used as the case definition for severe disease, as it is not comparable across settings.
Several definitions of severe disease, including those used in clinical trials, can be found in Annex 3:
Possible case definitions; inclusion and exclusion ( ). The definitions used in the Phase III clinical trials

8

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

and the Solidarity treatment trial rely on variables that might only be available in advanced hospital
settings, such as level of ventilatory support. For L/MICs, we recommend the use of one of two more
widely applicable definitions to screen for cases.
1. WHO COVID-19 case management definition for severe or critical disease:
Adolescent or adult with clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnoea, fast breathing) plus
one of the following: respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; severe respiratory distress; or SpO2 < 90% on
room air; or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, septic shock, or death (38). (Death not
included in case management definitions but can be included in VE evaluation definition.)
2. WHO surveillance case definition for Severe Acute Respiratory Illness Infection (SARI):
A hospitalized person with acute respiratory infection, with a history of fever or measured fever of
≥ 38°C and cough with onset within the last 10 days (39).
Which definitions to use will depend on the site of enrolment; the case management definition does not
require admission to hospital. In addition, we recommend that regardless of which case definition is used,
all the relevant variables for both definitions be collected, as measured values, rather than in categories,
where possible (e.g. percentage oxygen saturation, breaths per minute, at time of admission or enrolment),
so that post-hoc comparisons of evaluations can be done using the same definitions of severity.

3.3 Symptomatic COVID-19 disease
Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2, i.e. COVID-19, is the primary outcome of most vaccine clinical trials, usually
including severe and non-severe disease.
Many people with mild symptoms of COVID-19 disease will not present for medical care; to capture
all such cases for VE evaluations would require frequent active follow-up. However, some percentage
of symptomatic cases will present for health care; this could be in outpatient settings or hospitals. In
most places, it will be more feasible logistically to focus enrolment among medically attended cases.
Nonetheless, because the decision to seek health care as well as the decision to test someone for
COVID-19 at a health facility, can be influenced by multiple factors, including vaccination status, bias
can be introduced (see Section 7. Bias in VE studies of COVID-19 vaccines( )). To minimize this bias, we
suggest that screened participants should meet a minimal set of clinical criteria suggestive of an acute
respiratory tract infection. We suggest that L/MICs choose either the WHO surveillance case definition (40)
or the influenza-like illness (ILI) case definition (39), especially if using a pre-existing ILI platform.
Modified WHO surveillance case definition:
A person who has had the following symptoms within the last 10 days:
Acute onset of fever AND cough; OR
Acute onset of ANY THREE OR MORE of the following signs or symptoms: fever, cough, general
weakness/fatigue, headache, myalgia, sore throat, coryza, dyspnoea, anorexia/nausea/vomiting,
diarrhoea, altered mental status.
ILI case definition:
A person with an acute respiratory infection with measured fever of ≥ 38°C, cough, with onset within
the last 10 days.

3. Outcomes of interest for VE evaluations

9

As with severe disease, all the variables for both definitions should be collected so as to apply either case
definition when comparing VE evaluations.

3.4 COVID-19 Infection and transmission
Some vaccines have been shown to prevent disease and infection (e.g. measles), while others prevent
disease, but not infection (e.g. tetanus). A related question to if vaccines prevent COVID-19 infections
is whether they decrease infectiousness among people who become infected. The extent to which the
vaccine can reduce infection and infectiousness will determine how much vaccines can contribute to herd
immunity and thereby to reducing transmission, protecting both vaccinated and unvaccinated people
to some extent from exposure to the virus. Also, if vaccines can reduce infection, it would indicate that
vaccination of children, who do not frequently experience severe disease, but who may participate in
transmission of the virus, may be important from a public health standpoint.
Despite the public health significance, evaluating VE against infection and transmission will be more
difficult than for disease outcomes. Evaluations of VE against infection are logistically challenging,
expensive, and will likely require long-term active testing of cohorts of vaccine recipients and non-vaccine
recipients, regardless of symptoms, either for detection of virus or antibodies to indicate exposure. While
this can be done as part of a clinical trial in an unbiased way, VE evaluations of infection in observational
studies can be subject to the same biases as VE evaluations for disease outcomes (41). Moreover, following
a cohort of unvaccinated individuals over time might pose ethical issues, especially after vaccine supply
has improved.
Short of formal studies, early indications of the effects on transmission will be provided by evaluation of the
change in epidemiology of disease in groups that are not vaccinated (particularly those living or working
in close proximity to those vaccinated). Reduction of transmission might be observed through phased
introductions of vaccine that show reduction in disease among both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons
in vaccinated areas compared with unvaccinated areas. Evaluation of infection rates among households
with and without vaccinated household members can be a targeted and efficient approach to address the
VE against transmission. A generic standardized WHO protocol exists for household transmission studies
and can be adapted to estimate the VE against transmission (42). However, these can be challenging to
undertake especially in light of widespread community transmission and/or multiple vaccinated persons
per household (43).
Despite the need for VE evaluations of infection and transmission, it is unlikely that these will be feasible in
many settings, at least early in the vaccine rollout when vaccine coverage is likely to be low in the general
population. Moreover, due to the need for active follow-up and testing among cohorts or households, VE
evaluations of infection and transmission will be several-fold more costly and logistically complicated than
those of disease. VE evaluations of infection and transmission have critical public health significance,
but we suggest that these should be undertaken as targeted special studies in a limited number of
places that have adequate resources and infrastructure to undertake studies of this type.

3.5 Laboratory-confirmed versus syndromic outcomes
In general, laboratory-confirmed outcomes have substantial advantages over syndromic outcomes for
COVID-19 VE evaluations. Laboratory-confirmed outcomes are much more specific for COVID-19 disease
than are syndromic outcomes based on clinical signs and symptoms. Even during periods of high incidence
of COVID-19 disease, other pathogens can cause similar respiratory illness syndromes, including other
10

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

coronaviruses, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), para-influenza, and bacterial causes. Because
syndromic outcomes will be less specific for COVID-19, VE estimates based on syndromic outcomes
will always be lower compared with those using laboratory-confirmed outcomes. Additionally, given
the potential that vaccines are less effective against some SARS-CoV-2 variants, laboratory-confirmed
outcomes (with genomic characterization) may allow for calculation of VE estimates against specific
variants if the sample size is sufficient (see Section 8. Laboratory ( )). In addition, all Phase III clinical
trials have used laboratory-confirmed outcomes; therefore, if VE evaluations are being done to compare
efficacy from clinical trials with real-world VE, then it will be important to make that comparison using
laboratory-confirmed outcomes. For these reasons, we recommend the use of laboratory-confirmed
outcomes for COVID-19 VE evaluations, ideally with rRT-PCR.

3.6 Duration of protection
One of the most important questions about COVID-19 vaccines is for how long they will prevent disease
and/or infection. Because clinical trials might only follow-up participants for a few months for efficacy
outcomes, assessing longer duration of protection of these vaccines will likely require post-licensure VE
evaluations.
Clinical trials will assess primary vaccine failure, i.e. what percentage of individuals are not protected
against disease soon after vaccination. Secondary vaccine failure can be considered as a waning of
protection over time (44). For some vaccines, waning can be detected by serological surveys that show
decreases in protective antibody concentrations over time. These surveys are more useful from a policy
perspective when there is an established correlate of protection; however, at this time, no correlate of
protection is known for COVID-19. Moreover, as with some other vaccines (e.g. hepatitis vaccines) some
degree of protection might be due to cellular immunity, which might vary depending on vaccine type
and dose. The role of immunological markers in assessing waning of protection due to COVID-19 vaccines
needs to be further studied.
Several biases can affect VE evaluations of duration of protection, particularly spurious waning of VE due to
differential rates of infection and depletion of susceptible persons between vaccinated and unvaccinated
cohorts (see Section 7. Bias in VE studies of COVID-19 vaccines ( )). Bias of the VE over time can also occur
if either health seeking or diagnostic testing changes over time, or with age, and is related to vaccination
status.
There are several ways to try to distinguish true waning of VE from biased estimates of waning.
1. Look for increases in the absolute number or absolute rate of breakthrough cases among only
vaccinated individuals with increasing time since vaccination for a specific vaccine product. This
might give an initial signal that protection is waning, though care should be taken as the number
of breakthrough infections would also increase as transmission increases. It is helpful to collect
information about severity of disease as an indicator of whether vaccine modifies disease severity,
and if so whether severity of disease in breakthrough cases increases over time since vaccination. It
is also critical to collect information on the circulating strains as this could impact VE over time and
confound the trend in breakthrough cases. Outbreak investigations that examine the relationship
between time since vaccination among cases can facilitate this approach, as has been done for other
vaccine-preventable diseases (45).
2. Related to 1 above, follow a cohort of only vaccinated individuals and compare rates of disease in strata
defined by duration since date of vaccination. Temporal and geographic trends in incidence of disease
3. Outcomes of interest for VE evaluations

11

in the general population can confound this and should be controlled for in the analysis (45). If there
are individuals with varying dates of vaccination all during a period of low incidence, this comparison
can be especially informative as it makes the depletion-of-susceptibles bias less plausible (46).
3. Optimize the study design of VE evaluations using standardized case definitions and rigorous collection
of potential confounders, particularly health care seeking behaviour and clinician testing bias, to
allow adjustment in the analytic phase. In addition, data on potential indicators of high exposure or
susceptibility should be collected and included in the analysis (47). This will also enhance the ability to
combine data from different studies and perform meta-analyses of duration of protection.
4. Biases of waning VE can affect different control groups differentially. Using different methods, such as
both a test-negative design (TND) and a case-control design in which controls are frequency matched
by date of enrolment to allow better approximation of true waning (48).
5. Groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated can be “anchored” in time. For example, matching vaccinated
and unvaccinated persons in age and time of follow-up since vaccination of the matched vaccinated
person, and then analyse VE by strata of follow-up time. Anchoring in time, however, can still be affected
to some degree by depletion-of-susceptibles bias.
6. Use advanced statistical analytic methods that are able to better adjust for time-dependent variables
that could confound the VE estimate over time (49–51).

12

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

4. Assessing COVID-19 vaccination history
As part of an observational COVID-19 VE evaluation, each subject’s COVID-19 vaccination history must
be ascertained. The ultimate goal is to assess whether the subject has received a vaccine prior to disease
onset, which vaccine, how many doses, and when. This means that the vaccination status, the vaccine
product (for each dose), and the timing of vaccination need to be determined, by recording the number,
product, and dates of vaccinations. Timing of vaccination is important to make sure subjects are counted
as vaccinated only after they have received vaccine (with a time period to allow the vaccine to take effect);
various time periods after vaccination can be considered as immunologically protected in the analysis.
Vaccination history can be assessed in several ways:
One approach is to rely on administrative records created by vaccination programmes, such as patients’
vaccination cards. As part of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, countries are recommended to issue
standardized vaccination cards to all persons who are vaccinated.
Another approach is to assess COVID-19 vaccination status through either electronic or paper vaccination
registries. Where available, these registries can greatly facilitate the determination of the vaccination
status of participants. However, in some settings it may be difficult to match a participant to a record in
the registry and data entry errors can lead to incorrect information in the registries. Registry recorded
vaccine receipt has high specificity but variable sensitivity depending on quality controls in place.
If a person reports not being vaccinated, then such data can be accepted from self-report, but ideally, a
search of vaccination registries should be attempted to confirm the absence of vaccination. If there is no
documentation of vaccination but self-report of having received vaccine, then a secondary analysis can
be undertaken in which the verbal report of vaccination is accepted. Note that persons providing selfreported vaccination history will be unlikely to know which vaccine product(s) was provided, challenging
the calculation of product-specific VE in countries where multiple vaccine products are in use.
Due to limitations of recall bias, the lack of product information and dates of vaccination, we recommend against
the use of self-reported COVID-19 vaccination as the sole source indicating that a person is vaccinated.
At a minimum, COVID-19 vaccination programmes should ensure a systematic way to record vaccine
history so that the information is easily accessible (52). If record keeping related to COVID-19 vaccinations
can be designed with subsequent observational studies in mind, the likelihood of successfully executing
those observational studies will be much greater.

At a minimum, the following data should be obtained for each participant:
Has the person been vaccinated?
How many doses of vaccine has the person received?
Is this based on patient/parental recall or documentation (e.g. vaccination card, immunization registry, medical records)?
What is the date of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose 1?
What is the product name of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose 1?
What is the date of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose 2?
What is the product name of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose 2?

4. Assessing COVID-19 vaccination history

13

Ideally, one would pilot methods for collecting vaccine history before beginning any VE evaluation.
This pilot testing should assess the accuracy and completeness of any proposed method for measuring
vaccination history, and protocols should be adapted accordingly. In some cases, incorporating multiple
approaches for assessing vaccination status may be the best way to ensure that vaccine information is
complete and accurate.

14

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

5. Measuring covariates
Covariates are variables that are collected as part of the enrolment process into VE evaluations, which are
separate from those that define the exposure (i.e. vaccination) and the outcome (i.e. COVID-19 disease/
infection). Table 1 lists important covariates to consider collecting. The table distinguishes covariates that
are deemed as core variables to be collected in all VE evaluations, from those considered optional; some
covariates are core for some study designs only. Standardized variables and related questionnaires for
some of those covariates are proposed by WHO as part of the Unity Studies standardization initiative (53).
There are several reasons to collect information on covariates. First, they facilitate description of the
population studied, and allow for assessment of the similarities of characteristics between groups being
compared (i.e. vaccinated vs unvaccinated, those with and without COVID-19). An important reason for
a descriptive analysis is to characterize the study population’s risk of COVID-19. Second, some covariates
will be confounders or effect modifiers of the VE estimates. Confounders are those variables that are
related to both COVID-19 and vaccination status, and not in the causal pathway between vaccination and
disease prevention, which can potentially distort the VE estimate. Potential confounders of COVID-19 VE
evaluations include previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, access to health care, socioeconomic status (SES), and
risk reduction behaviours such as mask use and social distancing. Effect modifiers are variables that define
subgroups in which VE could be truly different. Effect modifiers could be age, chronic medical conditions,
or certain medications. At this early stage of VE evaluations, it is not clear whether some covariates will
be potential confounders, effect modifiers, or both.

6. Study designs
Observational VE studies aim to emulate a randomized trial, in which vaccinated and unvaccinated
individuals are comparable in their likelihood of being exposed to the virus and experiencing the outcome,
apart from the key difference of whether they have received the vaccine. Observational studies cannot
guarantee this comparability because vaccination is not randomly assigned, but they can attempt to
approximate it using a variety of designs (57). The common weakness of all observational evaluations is
that vaccinated and unvaccinated groups potentially differ in key characteristics, such as risk of infection
and access to testing, and measures should be taken to minimize this difference in all designs. Each design
has strengths and weaknesses, and some designs are better for evaluating certain populations and in
particular settings. Some study designs are less amenable to most L/MIC settings due to constraints
of existing infrastructure and resource requirements. Ideally, planning for the evaluation should begin
prior to implementation of a vaccination programme, as performing VE evaluations soon after vaccine
rollout often gives the least biased estimate of VE. In many target age groups, vaccination coverage can
quickly become very high making most VE designs challenging. In addition, consulting investigators
with prior field experience in designing and implementing these evaluations will greatly facilitate the
implementation of evaluations. Table 2 outlines the main study designs to evaluate VE against COVID-19
disease outcomes.

6.1 Cohort studies
Cohort studies follow a population, with known (though possibly changing over time) vaccination
status on each day, over a period of time. Disease incidence is calculated among vaccinated and
unvaccinated persons. The cohort method can be used either prospectively before disease has occurred,
or retrospectively using historical data in which disease has already happened. In both prospective and
retrospective cohorts, vaccination status at the time of disease occurrence is determined. The cohort
design allows direct calculation of the rate of disease in vaccine recipients versus non-vaccine recipients,
leading to estimation of risk reduction of disease among vaccinated persons. A person can contribute
both unvaccinated and vaccinated person-time, if vaccinated during the course of follow-up. Despite
these advantages, cohort designs require a large sample size and are resource intensive as follow-up
needs to be conducted serially for a duration of time. Moreover, vaccinated persons often differ in key
characteristics from unvaccinated persons, leading to biases, and these patterns may change over time

6. Study designs

19

during the course of a prioritized vaccine rollout; though this bias can be addressed, at least in part, by
matching and assessed by calculation of VE for negative control outcomes (e.g. time period or for a disease
when no effectiveness expected) (56).
Due to these constraints, cohort studies should only be taken in a limited number of settings with capacity
for rigorous follow-up to determine vaccine and disease status and adequately adjust for confounding
(e.g. accurate and complete covariates). Cohorts can potentially be built onto existing population-based
studies, such as demographic surveillance sites, or focus on specific vaccine-targeted populations in
which follow-up can be more efficient and complete (e.g. health workers). Lastly, if vaccine is already
recommended for a given group, it could be unethical to observe unvaccinated persons in that group over
time without actively facilitating vaccination. However, in practice, some persons might choose not to be
vaccinated, or there might be a gradual programmatic rollout of vaccines, and this group can ethically be
included as non-vaccine recipients.

6.2 Case-control studies
In the case-control design, investigators identify individuals who were diagnosed with COVID-19 (i.e.
cases), and a comparison group of individuals who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 (i.e. controls).
Various approaches to selecting controls from the underlying population have been proposed; concurrent
enrolment of cases and controls at the same time is encouraged to minimize time-variant exposure
differences (58). COVID-19 vaccination history is then determined for all cases and controls, and the odds
of vaccination in each group is calculated. Control enrolment should be concurrent to cases by time (e.g.
onset of symptoms or testing) in a high-incidence setting, as with COVID-19 in most settings currently.
Advantages of the case-control design include efficiency in terms of cost and time to conduct the
evaluation and the opportunity to address other parameters of interest (e.g. VE of less than full series of
doses, duration of protection). Case-control studies of VE are inherently problematic in finding an unbiased
control group that is comparable to cases in most characteristics apart from disease status, and which is
not affected in some way by vaccination. Specifically, one needs to choose controls who have similar viral
exposure risk and vaccination coverage to the population from which cases come. Both hospital-based
and community controls have unique biases and challenges in enrolling an unbiased comparison group
(59, 60). Lastly, COVID-19 should not be in the causal pathway of the reason for hospitalization when using
hospitalized controls (e.g. COPD exacerbation caused by COVID-19).

6.3 Test-negative case-control design (TND)
This is a widely used method for estimating influenza and rotavirus VE due to its logistical ease and
minimization of some biases (6, 7). It is most often viewed as a variant of the case-control design but can
also be considered as a cohort design in which all individuals who do not meet the clinical case definition
that prompts testing (usually the vast majority) are lost to follow-up. In a health facility (either inpatients
or outpatients), patients who seek care for a defined set of symptoms/signs are enrolled in the evaluation
and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Cases are those that test positive; controls are those that test negative. It
is possible that an existing surveillance platform, such as SARI or ILI surveillance, can be leveraged for
COVID-19 VE evaluations (see Section 10. Platforms to do COVID-19 VE evaluations ( )). The TND has
several advantages. First, all cases and controls have sought care at the same facilities. Hence cases and
controls will generally have come from the same communities, reducing bias due to community-level
variations in vaccine access and disease risk. Secondly, cases and controls have all sought care and been

20

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

tested for a similar set of symptoms. This reduces confounding due to differences in health care seeking
behaviour or access between cases and controls, which is often a source of bias in traditional case-control
studies, particularly in outpatient settings where care seeking can be more variable. Third, vaccine status
is typically collected and recorded at the time of specimen collection, prior to knowing the test result,
reducing the likelihood of differential exposure misclassification.
Given the current burden of COVID-19 and the low levels of other circulating viruses, it might be
challenging to enrol sufficient numbers of test-negative controls in this design (61, 62). Thus, investigations
should consider a second set of controls (persons admitted for non-COVID-like illness who also test
negative) to ensure sufficient controls are enrolled.
One particular concern of the TND is that misclassification of cases and controls can occur due to lack of
perfect test performance. This is particularly relevant for VE evaluations of severe COVID-19 disease, as
these patients tend to become severely ill after the first week of illness when viral RNA might no longer
be detectable in the upper respiratory tract (URT). However, even with subpar sensitivity, in the context
of near-perfect specificity such as provided by PCR testing, false negatives will have a negligible impact
on VE estimates derived by TND (63). Additionally, if there is concern that persons present later in the
course of their illness, one could consider adding exclusionary criteria for those persons who test negative,
but who are highly likely to have COVID-19 (40). For example, if a person tests negative, but is found to
have recent onset of anosmia or ageusia or chest imaging showing findings suggestive of COVID-19, this
person could be excluded from enrolment retrospectively (or excluded in a sensitivity analysis). The TND
can also be subject to the same biases as other study designs, and the TND introduces some new biases,
such as collider bias (64). Several ways to mitigate the biases of TND are outlined in the section on bias (see
Section 7. Bias in VE studies of COVID-19 vaccines ( )). Although not without biases, we recommend
conducting the TND as an efficient and accurate method in L/MICs to assess VE against severe and
symptomatic COVID-19.

6.4 The screening method (case-population method)
The screening method is a pseudo-ecologic design, which uses individual-level data on vaccination
history from cases, and vaccination coverage in the source population from which the cases came. It
is an attractive method in settings where disease surveillance data are available, but where few other
resources are available as it does not require ascertainment of vaccination status of non-cases. Only two
data points are needed to calculate VE: the proportion of reported cases occurring in vaccinated persons,
which can be calculated from surveillance data; and the vaccination coverage in the population, which
may be estimated from vaccine coverage surveys or available from a national registry or administrative
databases. As such, it is relatively easy to perform and inexpensive (65).
The screening method requires valid coverage estimates corresponding precisely to the population from
which cases came. For COVID-19 vaccines, this is unlikely to be available in the first year as denominators
for many of the target populations are unclear and coverage would need to be available by each targeted
group. Moreover, coverage will likely be rapidly changing in the accelerated vaccine rollout phase. It can
be difficult to adjust for some potential confounders using this design, given lack of individual-level data
in the population. Studies using the screening method should only be undertaken in settings where
vaccine coverage is stable and can be measured with high accuracy. We therefore recommend against
the use of screening method designs for estimating COVID-19 VE in the early stages of vaccine
rollout when vaccine coverage is rapidly changing; it could potentially be used in defined settings
where coverage is more stable.

6. Study designs

21

Note that the screening method was originally developed to serve as a “screening” tool to understand if the
proportion of cases who have received vaccine are within the expected range, or if there is a need for more
rigorous investigation. For example, if a vaccine has a true VE of 70%, at 75% coverage in the population,
then it would be expected that approximately half of the COVID-19 cases would be vaccinated; at 90%
VE and 90% coverage, one would also expect about half of the cases to be vaccinated (65). Therefore, the
screening method serves as a useful tool to determine if the number of vaccine breakthorough cases is
within the expected range.

6.5 Regression discontinuity design (RDD)
RDD is a quasi-experimental design that does not randomize individuals or units but leverages
programmatic assignment of vaccine allocation based on a clear cut-off value (66). In the case of COVID-19
vaccines this would likely be an age cut-off for older adults or for adolescents in whom the vaccine is not
authorized, versus slightly older individuals in whom it is. RDD assumes there is a similar risk of disease and
distribution of confounders in “a small neighbourhood” around the cut-off (e.g. 5 years above and below
age cut-off ) (67). Rates of COVID-19 would be compared between those eligible for vaccination above the
age cut-off and not eligible for vaccine below the age cut-off, allowing for calculation of a rate ratio and
a VE estimate. The advantages of the RDD are that it minimizes selection bias in self-determined vaccine
allocation and minimizes temporal and geographic trends among the comparison groups. However, RDD
has several disadvantages including how to define the number of years around cut-off before groups begin
to differ, small sample size in the “neighbourhood” around cut-off, spillover vaccination if the vaccination
cut-off is not adhered to, herd protection among unvaccinated persons (e.g. spouses of different ages),
and rapid age de-escalation of vaccine rollout. Moreover, in many L/MICs, older persons might not know
their exact age so applying strict age cut-offs for vaccination will be challenging. While RDD is a powerful
design, it is likely suitable in few settings where its limitations can be addressed.

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

7. Bias in VE studies of COVID-19 vaccines
Due to lack of randomization of persons to vaccination in real-world settings, observational studies are
subject to bias, which leads to a systematic deviation of the VE found in studies from the true VE. Biases
may cause deviations in either direction making the vaccine look more or less protective than it is, and
the magnitude of particular biases may change during the course of a study. Confounding is a type of
bias in which a third variable is associated with both vaccination and disease but is not in the causal
chain from vaccine to disease prevention. Some potential confounders are known and can be measured
and potentially controlled for in the analysis, while others are unknown and/or unmeasurable. Selection
bias can occur when criteria for inclusion in the analysis (for example, not having had a documented
prior infection with COVID-19) induce non-comparability between those who have and have not been
vaccinated (68, 69). Selection bias is harder to control for in the analysis and is better addressed in the
design and execution of the study. All observational studies – and indeed many randomized studies –
are susceptible to bias. It is important to recognize that while some designs and analytic methods can
minimize biases, none can fully eliminate them from observational studies. Nonetheless, this does not
mean that such studies should not be undertaken; rather efforts should be made to minimize biases, and
the results should be interpreted with the potential for residual biases in mind.
For most biases, undertaking studies when vaccine coverage in the vaccine target group is neither too low
(< 10%) nor too high (> 90%) is recommended, as persons who get vaccinated first, or do not get vaccinated
when coverage is high, tend to have different levels of risk of exposure and/or disease, resulting in greater
likelihood of biases. In areas with rapid uptake of vaccines in target populations, to avoid being left with
a biased comparison group, the evaluation will likely need to be done over a several month period. Of
note, highly effective vaccines might make the impact of bias less consequential, as VE estimates postintroduction will likely still be high enough to not lead to changes in existing vaccine policy.

to minimize them.

7. Bias in VE studies of COVID-19 vaccines

25

Some of the more relevant biases for COVID-19 VE evaluations are further described here.
Confounding: This can occur when a person’s vaccination status is associated with their risk of being
exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This bias can lead to either spuriously high or low VE estimates. If vaccinated
persons are those who are at increased risk, for example, health workers treating COVID-19 patients,
the risk of exposure is greater, leading to decreased estimates of VE. Conversely, some people who
choose not to get vaccinated might also choose not to engage in NPIs, putting them at higher risk of
infection, thereby leading to spuriously elevated VE estimates. Importantly, this form of bias can occur
even in TND. Confounding may be a particularly important concern for VE studies in highly effective
vaccination campaigns, which rapidly reach a large number of people in targeted groups, leaving those
unvaccinated (or vaccinated late) either very different from those within their targeted groups who do
get vaccinated (for example, members of an older age group with little social connection or access to
information) or leaving mainly members of non-targeted (e.g. young healthy) groups unvaccinated.
Careful statistical control for such confounding is likely to be very important to minimize bias in such
circumstances.
Health care seeking/access: People who have better access or higher tendency to utilize health care
will both be more likely to get vaccinated and present for care when symptomatic, including with
COVID-19. In traditional case-control studies, this would lead to over-representation of vaccinated
individuals as cases, which would decrease the VE estimate. TNDs partially mitigate this bias since all
enrolled persons have sought care. However, TNDs can lead to collider bias, whereby health seeking
and SARS-CoV-2 infection both lead to testing, which is usually thought to be of lower magnitude than
health care seeking bias (64).
Diagnostic bias: Clinicians might be less likely to order COVID-19 testing in vaccinated patients,
reasoning that vaccinated patients are protected against COVID-19. TND partially addresses this bias
since all participants are tested. The decision to test potential study subjects should not be based on
clinicians’ decisions but on prespecified protocol-defined criteria. These criteria should then be applied
to all (or to a random sample of ) eligible patients regardless of clinical testing decisions.
Misclassification of the outcome: Outcome misclassification occurs due to imperfect laboratory test
performance in diagnosing COVID-19 infection (72). Erroneous test results can be both false negative
and false positive. Because both rRT-PCR and rapid antigen tests tend to have higher specificity than
sensitivity, false-negative test results are more common. However, false-positive tests can result in
greater bias in estimating the VE (63, 73). Misclassification can bias the VE more in TND than in cohort or
traditional case-control studies because the control group in TND will be over-represented with falsenegative cases compared with the source population. Despite these concerns, misclassification bias is
likely small when using tests with high analytic sensitivity and specificity (see Section 8. Laboratory ( )).
This bias can be reduced by excluding test-negative controls with COVID-19 specific symptoms (e.g. loss
of taste or smell), and limiting participants to those with more recent symptom onset (e.g. ≤ 10 days)
to minimize the chance of enrolling true COVID-19 cases who present late when viral RNA is no longer
detectable. Another approach could be to have a second control group that is not enrolled as part of a
TND, but is derived from an alternate source, such as patients hospitalized with non-respiratory illness
(see Section 6.2 Case-control studies ( )). Lastly, a “bias-indicator” or “negative-control outcome” study
that measures the VE of COVID-19 vaccines against a sham outcome not caused by SARS-CoV-2 can
help quantify misclassification bias (70, 72, 74, 75).

26

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

Exposure misclassification: Given that disease outcomes are logged on the date of a positive test
rather than on the date at which an individual becomes infected, the effect of the vaccine may be
observed only after the incubation period plus an additional delay from symptom onset to the
individual’s test data, a delay that may vary by setting and health care availability. To ensure validity,
it may be necessary to exclude from the primary analysis outcomes occurring during the period of
approximately 14 days after the first dose and 7–14 days after the second dose, as the individual’s
immunization status when they were infected may be uncertain. This comes at a cost, particularly when
studying the VE of the first dose of a two-dose series, because it may lead to excluding more than half
the time between the first and second dose. However, failing to do so may include outcomes against
which the vaccine could not have protected the individual, thereby reducing the estimate of VE from
its true value (see Section 9.3.5 Time since vaccination ( )).
Spurious waning: This occurs if a vaccine only partially protects against infection, a so-called leaky
vaccine (76). The measured VE will decrease with time since vaccination, as the unvaccinated group
is depleted of non-immunes due to natural infection faster than in the vaccinated group, who get
partial protection against natural infection. This is more likely to occur in settings with a high force of
infection from SARS-CoV-2 during the follow-up period. This can affect all types of observational (and
randomized) studies, especially when some infections are unobserved because they are subclinical and/
or when exposure or infection risk is heterogeneous (46). VE estimates are more likely to be valid soon
after vaccination begins. For assessment of duration of protection, several approaches are discussed
elsewhere (see Section 3.6 Duration of protection ( )).
Prior infection: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection can create both confounding and non-confounding bias,
and VE could be different among previously infected persons compared with uninfected persons. If
persons were aware of having had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection they might be less likely to get vaccinated,
and also less likely to get disease if prior infection confers immunity as some data suggests (77). This
would create confounding, and a downward bias that could lead to lower or in extreme cases even
negative estimates of VE. Documenting known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection among study participants
might allow for a stratified analysis or exclusion for prior infection in the analysis, as would be
preferable in settings where policy discourages or prohibits those with known prior infection from
getting vaccinated. Unknown prior infection, such as asymptomatic infection, in contrast, is unlikely
to influence a person’s likelihood of getting vaccinated. Such infection probably still confers some
protection against subsequent disease. Therefore, asymptomatic infection is associated with disease,
but not vaccination, and is not a true confounder. Yet, unknown prior infection can still lead to biased
estimates of VE in cohort studies, in which VE is biased towards the null, compared with the value it
would have if evaluated in only unexposed individuals. The bias of unknown prior infection is likely
minimal in case-control studies, as it should occur in similar proportions of cases and controls. While
baseline serological status of participants in VE evaluations can allow for secondary analyses, in most
L/MIC settings it will not be possible to obtain baseline serology on all participants in VE evaluations,
and is not a requirement to undertake such evaluations. However, the baseline seroprevalence in the
population in which the evaluation is taking place, if known, can help to quantify the expected bias
on VE estimates.

8. Laboratory considerations
Laboratory-confirmed outcomes are more specific for SARS-CoV-2 infection than are outcomes based
on clinical signs and symptoms, which can overlap with other acute respiratory infection etiologies (see
Section 3.5 Laboratory-confirmed versus syndromic outcomes ( )). Accurate laboratory results from highly
sensitive and specific tests decrease the probability of misclassification. Thus, we recommend the use of
laboratory-confirmed outcomes in VE evaluations.
However, the use of laboratory-confirmed outcomes in COVID-19 VE evaluations requires appropriate
laboratory capacity, including specimen collection, handling and storage, as well as molecular assay
technology and reagents. All of these activities require training of clinical staff to ensure standardized
specimen collection and handling, as well as training of laboratory staff to ensure proper processing and
testing of specimens.
Full details of specimen collection and laboratory testing are available from WHO (78).

BOX 3. BACKGROUN D IN FORMAT ION O N SA R S- C OV- 2 R N A D E T E C T I O N
Once an individual has been exposed to the virus, the virus may be detectable in the upper respiratory
tract (URT) 1–3 days before the onset of symptoms. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the URT is highest
around the time of symptom onset, after which it gradually declines (78). The presence of viral RNA in the
lower respiratory tract (LRT), and for a subset of individuals in the faeces, increases during the second
week of illness (79). In some patients the viral RNA may only be detectable for several days, while in other
patients it can be detected for several weeks, possibly months, although prolonged viral RNA detection
beyond a week rarely indicates the presence of live virus or ongoing infectiousness.

8.1 Testing for confirmatory diagnosis
8.1.1 Laboratory methods
The laboratory test used should be sensitive and highly specific. Nucleic acid amplification testing, such
as rRT-PCR, is the standard test for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection during acute illness,
with a high analytic sensitivity and specificity (80). At this time, we recommend the use of rRT-PCR for
laboratory testing of participants in VE evaluations.
Guidance from WHO on test performance characteristics are constantly being updated and should be
reviewed to ensure the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses can still be detected by the testing
modality chosen for the VE evaluation as new variants could lower sensitivity or specificity of the test (78).
Persons with indeterminate results should have the specimen retested, and if needed, the patient should
have a second specimen collected. Although other assays are available, including rapid antigen tests,
these are not ideal for VE evaluations due to issues of lower sensitivity and/or specificity at this time. Tests
with imperfect sensitivity and specificity bias a VE estimate, with specificity having more impact on the
VE estimate (63, 73). Ideally, any test used should have at least ≥ 85% sensitivity and ≥ 98% specificity to
minimize the risk of misclassification bias. A lower sensitivity and specificity will decrease the estimated
28

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

VE obtained from the evaluation. However, this might not be practical in settings relying on rapid tests. In
some instances, an algorithm can be applied to decrease the chance of misclassification. For example, in
cases where specificity is very high, but sensitivity is less than ideal, testing can first start with a rapid test,
and those who test positive are considered true positive and do not undergo further testing. Those who
test negative might be a false negative and should undergo another round of testing with rRT-PCR, with the
rRT-PCR results being considered the test results for classification as a case or not. Additionally, statistical
methods might be able to be applied to correct for imperfect sensitivity and specificity; consultation with
a statistician prior to launching a VE evaluation is recommended. Antibody testing should not be used
as the primary method to classify participants as cases or controls, due to unknown timing of infection
and false-negative results.

8.1.2 Specimen collection
While analytic sensitivity and specificity of rRT-PCR is high, clinical sensitivity and specificity could be much
lower for a variety of reasons, including poor specimen quality, specimen collection late in the course
of disease, or improper specimen handling (78). Furthermore, due to the need to enrol patients who will
likely have detectable SARS-CoV-2, laboratory-confirmed outcomes should be restricted to patients who
have a specimen collected within 10 days of illness onset.

8.1.3 Specimen type
SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in several body fluids and compartments, and the optimal specimen depends
on clinical presentation and time since symptom onset (81). At minimum, respiratory specimens should
be collected, as the virus is most frequently detected in respiratory material (78).
Upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens are adequate for testing early stage infections, especially
in asymptomatic or mild cases. Testing combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from one
individual has been shown to increase sensitivity for detection of respiratory viruses and improve the
reliability of the result. A few studies have found that individual nasopharyngeal swabs yield a more
reliable result than oropharyngeal swabs. Saliva and nasal swabs are not recommended as a diagnostic
specimens for SARS-CoV-2 by WHO as this time (78).
Lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens are advised if collected later in the course of the COVID-19
disease or in patients with a negative URT sampling and there is a strong clinical suspicion of COVID-19.
LRT specimens can consist of sputum, if spontaneously produced (induced sputum is not recommended
as this poses an increased risk of aerosol transmission) and/or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar
lavage in patients with more severe respiratory disease, though appropriate precautions must be taken
as these are aerosol-generating procedures.
For the purposes of a VE evaluation, it is recommended that all persons meeting the enrolment case
definition have a nasopharyngeal and/or an oropharyngeal swab specimen to determine their case status.

8.2 Genomic characterization
SARS-CoV-2 has developed multiple mutations, leading some viruses to be deemed variants of concern
due to higher transmissibility, severity or potential to evade vaccine-induced immunity. WHO has guidance
on when genomic characterization (e.g. sequencing) should be conducted as part of routine surveillance
(82). Genomic characterization within the context of VE evaluations offers an opportunity to contribute to
the global understanding of variants of concern, including whether current vaccines protect against them.
8. Laboratory considerations

29

If possible, all cases in VE evaluations, regardless of vaccine status, should have their specimen undergo
sequencing. If a sufficient number of cases have their samples sequenced, one could determine the VE
against commonly circulating variants. In the setting of multiple variants in circulation, sample size will
likely need to be inflated to estimate variant-specific VE. Influenza VE studies routinely evaluate VE against
influenza type/subtype separately, and in some analyses by clade (7, 83). If a country is unable to perform
sequencing, samples could be sent, along with information about vaccination, to a SARS-CoV-2 reference
laboratory for genomic characterization (84). All sequence data should be shared, with relevant vaccination
meta-data, through publicly available databases (78). Of note, if sequencing of all cases is not possible,
then sequencing a subset of cases to document the circulating variant composition of the population will
allow the results to be interpreted in the context of the predominant variants in circulation.

8.3 Testing for prior infection
Some enrolled participants in a VE evaluation will have had prior infection, potentially providing them
with natural immunity. This can bias the VE estimate, as described previously in Section 7. Bias in VE
studies of COVID-19 vaccines. We recommend ascertaining prior disease or infection based on history.
Additional accuracy in identifying prior infection could be achieved by collecting blood samples and
using serological testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in cohort studies or among controls, though
this will increase the complexity and cost of the evaluation and may not be feasible in most settings. The
performance of serologic assays varies widely in different testing groups (such as in patients with mild
versus moderate-to-severe disease as well as in young versus old), timing of testing and the target viral
protein (78). Furthermore, antibody detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 may also rarely cross-react with common
coronaviruses or other pathogens and thus yield false-positive results. Antibody testing for the purpose of
evaluation of prior history of COVID-19 can be conducted with lateral flow immunoassays (LFI), enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), or chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA). Careful consideration
should be made as to which antibody target is selected, as some targets, such as the antibody against
the spike protein could be generated from both vaccination and disease, and N protein antibodies tend
to wane faster after infection.

30

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

9. Statistical considerations
9.1 Sample size
As with any epidemiologic study, COVID-19 VE evaluations must be large enough to rule out chance as an
explanation for the evaluation results. The sample size needed to estimate VE will depend on a number
of factors, including the proportion of the population that is vaccinated, the incidence of the evaluation
outcome, the expected VE, and the desired precision of the VE estimates. Sample sizes can be calculated
following the methodology described by O’Neill (85). The formulas calculate a minimum sample sizes and
will need to be inflated to account for nonparticipation, stratification, adjustment for effect modifiers
and confounding, or exclusion factors that might be identified only after enrolment. Note, VE should be
calculated for each vaccine regimen separately (e.g. product A dose 1, product A dose 2 is one regimen
while product A dose 1, product B dose 2 is a different regimen). Thus, if participants in the evaluation are
expected to be vaccinated with a mix of vaccine products, the sample size will need to be increased to
ensure sufficient persons are enrolled based on the population coverage of each regimen. For the below
calculations, we have selected a precision of ± 10%, but this can be adjusted based on local needs and
resources. While a wider precision interval will result in a lower required sample size it will also lead to
less certainty in the interpretation of the VE estimate and will make secondary analyses that use a subset
of the sample more challenging.

9.1.1 Cohort study
For a cohort study, a formula (85) to calculate the minimum sample size is:
N = (z/d)2(1/ARU)((1–ARU)/ARU)+(1–ARU)/ARU)
= (z/d)2((1+1/Ψ)/ARU–2)
Where z denotes the (1-α) percentage point of the standardized normal distribution (normally this is
based on an α = 0.05 and thus z = 1.96); ARU denotes the assumed attack rate in the unvaccinated group,
ψ = 1-VE, where VE denotes the anticipated vaccine effectiveness; and d is determined by solving the
equation
where
denotes the confidence interval
(CI) width, i.e. the difference between the upper and lower limits.
Table 4 gives the minimum number of persons to enrol in
a cohort study to detect the specified VE against COVID-19
disease outcomes, assuming different attack rates in the
unvaccinated, and a precision of ± 10%, with a type 1
error rate (α) of 0.05. Achieving greater precision than
± 10% leads to large sample size requirements in a cohort
study and is unlikely to be feasible; longer follow-up times
might reduce the sample size required. Furthermore, as
the attack rate among the unvaccinated increases (i.e.
high transmission in community) the sample size needed
decreases. If the vaccine is highly effective, and coverage
is high, then the attack rate might decrease among both
unvaccinated and vaccinated due to herd protection,
requiring larger sample sizes than when coverage is lower
and there is more transmission.

9.1.2 Case-control and test-negative design study
For a case-control or test-negative design study, the formula (85) to calculate the minimum sample size
of cases (N1) is:
N1 = (z/d)2[1/A(1–A)+1/CP2(1–P2)]
Where C is the control to case ratio (e.g. C = 2 denoting 2 controls for every case); P2 denotes the prevalence
of vaccine exposure in the control group (i.e. vaccine coverage in the population being studied); A = P2(1VE)/[1-P2(VE)] where VE denotes the anticipated vaccine effectiveness; z denotes the (1-α) percentage point
of the standardized normal distribution (normally this is based on an α = 0.05 and thus z = 1.96); and d is
determined by solving the equation
where
denotes
the CI width, i.e. the difference between the upper and lower limits. The number of controls needed are
then calculate as C*N1.
Annex 2: Sample size ( ) gives the minimum number of persons to enrol in a case-control or test-negative
design study to detect the specified VE, assuming different vaccine coverages ranging from 20%–90%,
with 1–4 controls per case, and a precision of ± 5% and ± 10%, with a type 1 error rate of 0.05. Table 5 is a
brief synopsis to highlight the sample sizes needed. It should be noted that for the most part, higher VE
results in smaller samples sizes as does higher coverage in the control group. However, sample size again
increases when coverage is greater than 75%.

For each case, 1 to 4 control subjects could be identified. Enrolling more than 4 controls per case does not
increase power substantially. Increasing the number of controls per case helps to increase the efficiency,
thus decreasing the number of cases that need to be identified and can be useful in settings where
incidence of COVID-19 is low or in smaller sentinel sites which might not be able to enrol enough cases.
In many settings, where numbers of COVID-19 cases are large, it will likely be more efficient to increase
the number of cases enrolled rather than the number of controls per case.

32

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

For case-control studies, the method of sample size calculation proposed here pertains to unmatched
designs. The sample size needed for matched case-control designs requires methodology that accounts
for the matching factors and is beyond the scope of this document (85).

9.2 Matching
Selecting controls to be similar to case patients in particular characteristics in case-control studies, or
selecting unexposed and exposed individuals to be similar in cohort studies is termed “matching”. The
purpose of matching in cohort studies is to efficiently diminish the confounding effects of various factors,
particularly those that are difficult to adjust for in the analysis or factors that can be more efficiently
addressed by the study design. In case-control studies, matching can be performed to reduce variance
and improve precision but will create bias unless the matching is accounted for in the analysis (86, 87).
Matching presents challenges with the loss of flexibility in enrolment and potential for introduction of a
bias and imprecision due to overmatching. Matching on age to improve efficiency could be considered,
depending on the study setting and recommended vaccine target groups, as it is likely that VE among
certain age groups will likely be of public health interest. This can be achieved by frequency matching,
potentially in 10-year age bands if sufficient cases and non-cases/controls in each age band are enrolled.
It would be ideal to be able to match on other COVID-19 risk factors, but this is challenging to do
practically given the inability to quantify these risk factors easily. If conducting a multisite evaluation, it
is suggested to frequency match on enrolment site (or neighbourhood) to help account for differences
between populations at the different sites, such as sociodemographic factors that might be associated
with vaccine and disease status. For TND and case-control studies, participants should be matched by time
of enrolment (or this should be adjusted for in the analysis), as epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is constantly
changing as are the circulating variants and controls should be selected at a similar time period as cases.

9.3 Data collection, management and analyses
9.3.1 Data collection and management
Data should be collected to characterize study setting, including COVID-19 incidence at time of study,
vaccines in use, introduction dates, and timing of rollout in target groups, NPI measures in place, and
common circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Individual-level data should be collected by interviewing
participants using a study questionnaire, medical record review, laboratory record review, and vaccine
history review. An accurate, detailed vaccination history, including the vaccine product administered
and dates of vaccination, is critical and should ideally be obtained from written records (see Section 4.
Assessing COVID-19 vaccination history ( )). Data-collection forms should not include any identifiable
information (e.g. name) but instead use unique identifiers. A separate form should be maintained that links
the identifiers with participant names, and confidentiality must be maintained. Data collection should
comply with local data protection requirements. Data from each evaluation site should be entered into
the database and reviewed for completeness and any data entry errors. The database should undergo a
quality control process.

9.3.2 Characterizing participants
Several descriptive analyses are useful for characterizing the participants. Graphs of case counts over
time are informative for understanding the COVID-19 epidemic in the target population. These plots can

9. Statistical considerations

33

help in assessing whether calendar time is a potential confounder, particularly if coupled with plots of
vaccine uptake over time. Flowcharts of the enrolment process can be used to identify possible sources
of bias such as high rates of refusal to participate in the evaluation.
For the primary VE analysis, fully vaccinated participants should be compared with unvaccinated subjects.
Additionally, persons with prior infection should be included in the primary analysis in settings where
vaccination is given to all individuals in target groups regardless of prior infection status. In settings,
where prior infection is an exclusion from vaccination, the primary analysis should also be limited to
those without known prior infection.
Bivariate descriptive statistics are used to assess the distribution of covariates among the participants.
These are particularly useful for comparing covariate distributions between vaccinated versus unvaccinated
subjects and between COVID-19 cases versus non-cases/controls. These bivariate comparisons aid in
determining variables that may be included as potential confounders in adjusted VE estimates or variables
by which to stratify the analyses. The bivariate distributions are also useful for comparing the participants
in your evaluation with participants in other COVID-19 VE evaluations, as differences in evaluation
populations may contribute to different VE estimates.

9.3.3 Analytic approaches to estimate crude rate/odds ratios
In cohort studies, unadjusted (or crude) rate ratios can be obtained from the ratio of incidence rates of
COVID-19 outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. Unadjusted incidence rate ratios
can be calculated using 2×2 tables or regression models (e.g. Poisson, Cox-proportional hazards). In casecontrol and TND studies, unadjusted odds ratio estimates can be obtained from the ratio of the odds of
exposure (i.e. vaccination) among controls compared with cases. If matching was conducted, matching
should be factored into the analysis.

9.3.4 Assessing and adjusting for confounders
In planning the analyses, investigators should determine which measured covariates are acting as
confounders (see Section 5. Measuring covariates ( )), by identifying variables that are associated with
both vaccination and COVID-19. For this, the most appropriate method for the final selection of potential
confounders to include in statistical models is the “change-in-estimate” approach (88, 89). In the changein-estimate approach, the unadjusted VE is estimated using an appropriate statistical model. VE is then
estimated adjusting for a single covariate. If the adjusted VE differs from the unadjusted VE by more than
a pre-determined percentage, the covariate is considered to be a confounder and will be included in final
models. A common threshold is to include covariates whose adjustment changes the crude odds ratio/
rate ratio by 10% or more, but the threshold is at the investigators’ discretion.

9.3.5 Time since vaccination
COVID-19 VE evaluations differ from influenza VE evaluations because it is expected that people initially
unvaccinated may soon become vaccinated within a targeted group due to the rapid rollout of vaccines.
Moreover, unlike influenza vaccine that is usually given prior to the influenza season, COVID-19 vaccines
can be given during periods of high incidence. Therefore, some people will likely be infected soon after
vaccination, and so it will be especially important to define the time after vaccination when a person
would be considered immunologically protected. Moreover, it is possible that some people who have
systemic reactions to vaccination will present for COVID-19 testing in the days after vaccination, which
would lead to a bias in the VE estimate, particularly in the TND.

34

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

Thus, for the primary analysis of VE, a conservative approach should be taken in considering a person as
protected from vaccination as from 14 days after the date of the first dose of vaccine, and, if applicable,
7–14 days after the date of the second dose. However, while 14 days for the first dose and 7-14 days for
the second dose has been used in clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccines to date and is used most often
for other vaccines, the number of days post-vaccination to use in the primary analysis should be driven by
the specific product being evaluated (90). For cohort studies, this would be 14 days after vaccination and
for case-control and TND studies, this would be 14 days prior to disease onset (for cases in a traditional
case-control study and cases and controls in a TND), or hospitalization date (for hospitalized controls in a
traditional case-control study). While the 14-day cut-off for considering a person protected from vaccination
might reduce precision by excluding a certain number of cases (and vaccinated controls), it will optimize
the validity of the VE estimate. We recommend doing secondary analyses that use shorter intervals of time
after vaccination in considering people vaccinated (e.g. 7 days, 10 days); additional analyses can be done
for discrete intervals of days in the 14-day period after vaccination to assess the onset of VE (e.g. 7–13 days).
However, we recommend that investigators should not consider a person as unvaccinated in the few days
after vaccination as the exact number of days to start to achieve protection is not known; this will minimize
exposure misclassification bias (see Section 7. Bias in VE studies of COVID-19 vaccines ( )).

9.3.6 Final analyses of VE
Multivariable regression analysis allows adjustment for confounding variables. After identifying potential
confounders, final VE estimates can be calculated using the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) or rate ratio (aRR)
for vaccination using the following formula: VE = (1-(aOR or aRR)) × 100%. Regression modelling can also
quantify and measure the precision of any effect modification, in which VE differs by subgroup. If effect
modification exists, VE and CIs should be reported for each subgroup separately. VE should be calculated
separately for each vaccine regimen and for each product. At this time there is no WHO recommendation to
support mixing vaccine types for first and second doses, although the VE for mixed vaccine schedules will
be of interest if this has occurred in the study population and, if sample size allows, should be evaluated.
As with any analyses, appropriateness of the statistical methods should be reviewed with a statistician
with respect to model diagnostics and validity checks (e.g. goodness of fit, identification of outliers, and
assessment for multiple co-linearity).

9.3.7 Additional analyses
For the primary VE analysis, fully vaccinated participants should be compared with unvaccinated subjects.
For a secondary analysis, partially vaccinated subjects could be compared with unvaccinated subjects to
determine if partial vaccination is effective. Stratified analyses, based on subgroups and effect modifiers,
as well as common viral variants in circulation, are important to do if sufficient sample size allows
acceptable precision. Another secondary analysis of importance in areas with incomplete documentation
of vaccination status would be to accept verbal reports in addition to documented reports of vaccination.
Lastly, a secondary analysis can be done that excludes persons with a history of prior COVID-19, potentially
stratifying by lab-confirmed prior infection and clinically diagnosed and/or stratifying by the time since
prior infection if the sample size is large enough.
Additionally, a sensitivity analysis should be considered for some key variables to assess the robustness of
the VE estimate. Much is unknown still about COVID-19, and a sensitivity analysis allows one to understand
the impact of various choices for inclusion/exclusion into the final VE calculation. Examples of potential
sensitivity analyses include:
A sensitivity analysis of importance in areas with incomplete documentation of vaccination status
would be to accept verbal reports in addition to documented reports of vaccination, and compare this
9. Statistical considerations

35

with an analysis whereby all with verbal report are considered unvaccinated or vaccinated to assess
how the extremes of exposure misclassification would impact the VE.
A sensitivity analysis with respect to timing of the test in relationship to symptom onset. As cases
further into their clinical course might be less likely to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, VE can be evaluated
among those testing early as well as those testing later in relation to the course of illness to see the
impact of these potentially false negatives (81).
If a sufficient number of breakthrough cases are identified as part of the VE evaluation, then investigators
can consider doing an analysis looking at risk factors for breakthrough. However, most VE evaluations
will not be powered or designed to be able to assess risk factors for breakthrough infections adequately.

9.3.8 Interpretation and extrapolation of results from VE evaluations
The efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations will have been established by a limited number of pre-authorization
clinical trials; the findings of any VE evaluation should therefore be interpreted in light of the preauthorization trials. If VE is found to be different than expected, it is particularly important that further
investigation should be conducted (Box 4), including an examination of the vaccine management and
vaccine administration techniques. The results can then be used to take corrective action, if necessary
(65). The implementation of the evaluation and methods for analysis should also be examined to ensure
that case definitions were applied consistently, that case ascertainment was appropriate, vaccination
status was appropriately determined, that known confounders were controlled for and that identifiable
biases did not occur.
Unexpected findings should be followed up with a detailed programmatic and epidemiological evaluation.
It is important to note that a VE that is lower than expected, or even negative, should not be immediately
interpreted as evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED); more common causes, such as
bias, population differences, or waning protection, should first be considered. Moreover, confirmation of
VAED would likely need further investigation, including biomarker evaluations (91).

9.3.9 Pooling data from multiple VE evaluations
As noted above, robust sample sizes are needed to estimate VE, which can limit the assessment of VE
in important subgroups. One approach to enable stratified estimates by subgroups is to pool data from
separate VE evaluations. This can be done through meta-analysis of reported VE estimates, or through the
pooling of individual-level subject data. In either case, pooling data has several challenges that must be
considered. The evaluations being pooled need to be measuring the same outcome, for the same vaccine
product, at the same type of site of case capture (e.g. hospital vs outpatient clinic). Pooled evaluations
must be sufficiently similar in terms of case definitions, exclusion criteria, and vaccine status definitions.
The evaluations to be pooled must have similar data available on key covariates to include in adjusted VE
models. Perhaps most importantly, the evaluation settings must be similar enough that the pooled results
can be generalized. This means that the populations under evaluation must have comparable access to
vaccination and to health care for COVID-19 illness. For these reasons, we caution against pooling data
from populations that are heterogeneous with respect to the following: vaccine programmes or
policies, health systems or care seeking behaviours, or infection risk overall. This would apply to
pooling data from special populations, such as those in prisons or nursing homes, with general communitydwelling populations. If pooled analyses are to be attempted, qualitative and statistical heterogeneity
between populations should be assessed, and the best methods for meta-analysis or pooling data should
be determined in consultation with statisticians (92–94). Pooling individual-level data from multisite or
multicountry studies could be done if the same protocol is used a priori, as has been done in multicountry
evaluations of influenza VE, but there is still a need to account for heterogeneity (95, 96).

10. Platforms to do COVID-19 VE evaluations
A potentially efficient approach to conducting COVID-19 evaluations is to build an evaluation onto an
existing surveillance platform used for another purpose. However, various factors need to be considered
when deciding if an existing platform could be leveraged to conduct a COVID-19 VE evaluation.
Some factors to consider when deciding if an existing platform can be used include the following:
The ability to achieve the evaluation objective by using the existing platform (e.g. does it capture the
outcomes of interest?).
The alignment of the suspected COVID-19 case definition with the case definition used by the existing
platform, including inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The population being studied by the existing platform is eligible for vaccination.
The ability to recruit the target sample size.
The modifications to the case investigation forms that need to be made to ensure that COVID-19
vaccination history, potential COVID-19 confounders, and COVID-19 risk factors are collected.
The specimens currently collected and the ease of adding appropriate COVID-19 specimen collection
onto the platform.
The ability to conduct high-quality COVID-19 testing using existing laboratory capacity.
The additional resources that are needed to build a COVID-19 VE evaluation onto the existing platform
(e.g. collecting documentation of vaccination).
Some of the following platforms are already in place in countries and could be modified to conduct a VE
evaluation.
SARI surveillance: SARI surveillance is usually undertaken to identify circulating influenza strains and
to conduct influenza VE evaluations. The WHO recommended SARI case definition is a hospitalized
person with acute respiratory infection, with a history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38 C° and
cough with onset within the last 10 days (39). It is used to identify suspected cases for enrolment and
can be used without modification given that it can capture COVID-19 cases, but it is not so specific
as to exclude persons without COVID-19, making it amenable to TND studies. Of note, the SARI case
definition includes fever, and not all COVID-19 patients have fever, so some cases might be missed,
which could introduce a bias if COVID-19 symptoms are modified by vaccination. In addition, the same
specimen, usually a nasopharyngeal swab, is used to test for both influenza and COVID-19. The SARI
platform is best suited to understand VE for severe outcomes as all patients are hospitalized. Examples
of SARI networks include the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS); Red para
la Evaluación de la Efectividad de la Vacuna en Latino América y el Caribe – influenza (REVELAC-i);
Influenza - Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness in Europe (I-MOVE) network; and the Global Influenza
Hospital Surveillance Network (97–100).

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

ILI surveillance: ILI surveillance is undertaken for similar reasons as SARI surveillance, but usually
captures patients at outpatient facilities. Therefore, the ILI platform is best suited to understand VE
for non-severe disease, though the caveat is that an unknown proportion of ILI cases might go on to
hospitalization/severe disease. An ILI case is defined as a person with an acute respiratory infection with
measured fever of ≥ 38 C°, cough, with onset within the last 10 days (39). As with the SARI definition, the
ILI definition also includes fever so will not capture all COVID-19 cases. Some primary care networks,
such as I-MOVE, already participate in ILI surveillance and could be adapted to conduct COVID-19 VE
evaluations (97).
Inpatient sentinel surveillance for other diseases: Some countries have inpatient sentinel site
surveillance to identify outbreaks, to understand disease burden of known pathogens, and/or to
identify novel pathogens. Examples of sentinel site surveillance includes those for acute febrile
illness, pneumonia/LRT infection, invasive bacterial disease and acute gastroenteritis. Existing sentinel
surveillance platforms can offer a field team familiar with enrolment following a standard case
definition, specimen collection, and access to reliable clinical laboratories. However, unlike SARI and
ILI platforms, URT specimens might not be collected as part of sentinel surveillance platforms, and so
would require additional specimen collection. Moreover, case definitions for other diseases targeted by
sentinel surveillance are unlikely to capture sufficient numbers of COVID-19 cases, and if unmodified
might capture atypical clinical presentations (e.g. diarrhoea, fever without respiratory symptoms),
which could lead to biased VE estimates.
Health worker surveillance or cohorts: In some countries, health worker surveillance or cohort
studies are being undertaken to identify risk factors for infection, determine serial seroprevalence, or
as part of an institutional infection control and prevention strategy. Such surveillance among health
workers can be amenable to VE studies, particularly cohort designs. As part of the Unity Studies, WHO
has developed a health worker cohort study that could be modified to conduct VE studies (101).
COVID-19 adverse events following immunization (AEFI) studies: AEFI studies might be able to be
leveraged to evaluate duration of immunity and in some cases, to estimate VE. The advantage of using
an AEFI platform is that detailed information on vaccination history will already be collected. Moreover,
for most COVID-19 AEFI studies, severe COVID-19 disease will likely be an outcome of interest due to
the concern of VAED. In places where a cohort of only vaccinated persons are followed (cohort event
monitoring [CEM]), one can follow the cohort to determine if and when persons develop COVID-19
disease after vaccination, and an analysis can be done to understand the duration of vaccine protection
(102). However, to evaluate COVID-19 VE, a comparison group of unvaccinated persons would need to
be added to AEFI CEM platforms. Additionally, most AEFI CEM studies end after 3 months, and a longer
duration (at least 1 year) of follow-up would be valuable to understand the duration of protection.
Administrative databases: In some settings, detailed medical records or administrative databases
that document both disease outcomes and vaccination history might exist or could be created through
record linkage. A single comprehensive database for participants in managed health care organizations
or large hospitals might be available, making extraction of key variables for both COVID-19 cases, and a
set of controls, efficient. In other settings, separate databases might be linked by patient identification
numbers to extract all the requisite variables. However, such comprehensive databases are unlikely to
exist in most L/MICs. When evaluating these databases, it is important to understand potential testing
algorithms in place and the sensitivity/specificity of each variable. Each database needs to be evaluated
to ensure quality.

10. Platforms to do COVID-19 VE evaluations

39

Outbreaks: Outbreaks of COVID-19 can serve as settings to undertake VE evaluations efficiently.
Outbreaks in well-defined populations, such as long-term care facilities, military barracks, prisons,
hospitals or schools, offer ideal settings. Statistical efficiency is greatest when a proportion of the
outbreak population, approximately 30%–70%, has been vaccinated at least 2 weeks before the
onset of the outbreak as part of routine rollout of vaccines. Other characteristics of the outbreak that
optimize VE evaluations are to institute COVID-19 testing of all persons during the outbreak period,
or at least all symptomatic persons, as well as enough cases to have good precision around the VE
estimate (e.g. > 30 cases). Both cohort and case-control studies can be undertaken in outbreak settings.
As mentioned, the screening method might also be applicable as the vaccine coverage among cases
and the entire outbreak population will likely be known; the screening method can be particularly
useful in anticipating the expected number of vaccinated cases (65). Moreover, if outbreaks occur in
multiple facilities, some of which have been vaccinated and some not, comparison of the outbreak
size, duration and severity can be made to assess the vaccine’s impact on outbreaks. Of note, COVID-19
vaccination as a response measure to an outbreak is not being widely recommended at this time due
to time lag in achieving population immunity. VE evaluations in outbreak settings are susceptible to
the same biases as all VE evaluations, including some additional ones such as the implementation of
non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) measures as part of the outbreak
response.

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

11. Protection of human subjects and informed
consent
COVID-19 vaccines introduced into countries will have been authorized by national regulatory authorities
as safe for routine use. Participants in VE studies will not have been randomized to receive vaccine and
will likely be identified through routine clinical testing and/or public health surveillance. Moreover,
demonstrating COVID-19 VE through studies in the groups targeted for vaccination will provide essential
information to ministries of health to assess the health and public health benefits of the vaccination
programme, and inform future policy decisions. For these reasons, in some countries, VE evaluations
might be deemed public health programme evaluation and/or surveillance and be given non-research
determination. In many countries, this determination is done by an expedited review of the protocol by
an ethical review committee (ERC). The ERC might determine to exempt the protocol as non-research,
and therefore not require informed consent, or they might require full ethical review and approval. In
the latter case, the ERC could determine that either verbal or written informed consent is required from
participants. Specific consent procedures may be needed for unconscious or critically ill patients who
are unable to give written consent of their own volition (e.g. oral witnessed consent, consent by the next
of kin). Informed consent should outline risks and benefits of participation in the local language. Risks
to participants might be deemed those incurred by additional specimen collection (apart from those
done for routine clinical care), or if any questions on the questionnaire are felt to be of a sensitive nature.
Benefits to participants might be access to COVID-19 vaccines if they have not yet been vaccinated. The
voluntary nature of participation and the ability to withdraw consent without fear of reprisals should be
clearly stated. If consent is required, parents should be asked to provide it for their child, supplemented
by assent by the child (depending on their age). Templates for informed consent are available on the
WHO website (103). Regardless of ERC determination, all data must be protected, and confidentiality of
participants must be ensured.

12. Reporting of results
WHO encourages consistent and standardized reporting of results of COVID-19 VE evaluations for several
reasons. As with all observational studies, reports of COVID-19 VE evaluations should include sufficient
details on study participants, data collection, and analyses to enable readers to judge the validity of the
study. Lack of complete reporting of key VE study elements and heterogeneity in reporting will create
limitations in being able to compare across studies done in different settings. Without consistent reporting,
pooled analyses or meta-analyses that increase power to evaluate VE will be difficult to interpret, as
observed for influenza VE evaluations (104, 105). Lastly, as VE studies of COVID-19 vaccines start becoming
available, having a standardized format for reporting will facilitate ease of interpretation for the many
audiences that will be interested in these studies.
The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) consensus guidelines
were created to aid authors in ensuring high-quality presentation of observational studies (106). STROBE
guidelines consist of a minimum set of reporting elements for observational studies, typically compiled in
a checklist that authors must complete before submitting a relevant manuscript to a journal. These include
descriptions of setting, dates of enrolment and follow-up, case definitions, exposure measurement, sample
sizes, patients included/excluded, and key characteristics of the study participants. The STROBE guidelines
provide a starting point for COVID-19 VE reporting. However, due to specific features of VE studies
and unique aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology and vaccines, additional data elements for COVID-19specific VE studies expanding upon the STROBE checklist are recommended. We recommend reporting
on additional elements, as outlined in Annex 4: Reporting ( ). Standardized reporting of observational
studies of influenza VE studies, as well as other vaccines, by adapting STROBE recommendations has
been recommended by WHO’s Immunization and Vaccine-related Implementation Research Advisory
Committee (IVIR-AC) (107). Such adaptations of STROBE guidelines to specific categories of observational
studies have been done before (108). While many biomedical journals have word count limits which may
restrict reporting of all of these elements, most allow for online supplements which can accommodate
the additional data elements. Although not part of the STROBE guidelines, WHO encourages sharing of
COVID-19 VE evaluation databases in data repositories available to the public, to encourage transparency
and facilitate pooling of results (109).

Annex 3: Possible case definitions; inclusion
and exclusion criteria
A3.1 Possible case definitions
For TND and traditional case-control studies, having a strict case definition to determine enrolment
eligibility is extremely important as this helps to decrease some biases that can arise from variability in
clinical diagnosis. An enrolment case definition should be clear and be simple to apply by sites. Enrolment
case definitions for VE evaluations, however, should not be used to guide clinical management. A variety
of possible definitions are provided below, and each evaluation should use or modify the definition that
fits the objective of the evaluation and can be applied in the country setting.

Symptomatic COVID-19 disease

Suspected COVID-19 case
definition

Source of definition

Definition

Modification of WHO
COVID-19 surveillance
guidelines (40)

A person who has had the following symptoms within the last 10 days:
acute onset of fever AND cough;
OR
acute onset of ANY THREE OR MORE of the following signs or symptoms: fever, cough,
general weakness/fatigue, headache, myalgia, sore throat, coryza, dyspnoea, anorexia/
nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, altered mental status.

Influenza-like illness (ILI) WHO surveillance case
case definition
definition for ILI (39)

A person with an acute respiratory infection with measured fever of ≥ 38°C, cough, with
onset within the last 10 days.

Severe COVID-19 disease
If the objective of the evaluation is to assess VE against severe disease, severity must be defined within the
confines of what is feasible in the evaluation setting. Different severity scales exist and are provided below.
WHO SEVERITY SCALE
As defined by WHO’s Clinical management of COVID-19: interim guidance (38). Note that this severity scale
does not include death as these come from clinical treatment guidelines; death can be considered the
most severe form of disease.
Mild disease:
Someone who is symptomatic meeting the case definition for COVID-19 without evidence of viral
pneumonia or hypoxia.
Moderate disease:
• Adolescent or adult with clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnoea, fast breathing) but no
signs of severe pneumonia, including SpO2 ≥ 90% on room air.
• Child with clinical signs of non-severe pneumonia (cough or difficulty breathing + fast breathing and/
or chest indrawing) and no signs of severe pneumonia.
– fast breathing (in breaths/min): < 2 months: ≥ 60; 2–11 months: ≥ 50; 1–5 years: ≥ 40.

52

Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness

Severe disease:
• Adolescent or adult with clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnoea, fast breathing) plus one
of the following: respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; severe respiratory distress; or SpO2 < 90% on room
air.
• Child with clinical signs of pneumonia (cough or difficulty in breathing) + at least one of the following:
– central cyanosis or SpO2 < 90%; severe respiratory distress (e.g. fast breathing, grunting, very severe
chest indrawing); general danger sign: inability to breastfeed or drink, lethargy or unconsciousness,
or convulsions;
– fast breathing (in breaths/min): < 2 months: ≥ 60; 2–11 months: ≥ 50; 1–5 years: ≥ 40.
While the diagnosis can be made on clinical grounds; chest imaging (radiograph, CT scan, ultrasound)
may assist in diagnosis and identify or exclude pulmonary complications.
Critical disease:
A person with ARDS, sepsis or septic shock. Full details are available in WHO’s Clinical management of
COVID-19: interim guidance (38).
It is recommended to include death if using this definition as the most severe form of disease.

UNITED STATES FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION’S SEVERITY DEFINITION
This is suggested for use in Phase III clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines (111).
Severe COVID-19 is defined as virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any of the following:
• clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (respiratory rate ≥ 30 per minute, heart rate
≥ 125 per minute, SpO2 ≤ 93% on room air at sea level or PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mm Hg);
• respiratory failure (defined as needing high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical
ventilation or ECMO);
• evidence of shock (SBP < 90 mm Hg, DBP < 60 mm Hg, or requiring vasopressors);
• significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction;
• admission to an ICU;
• death.

Annex 3: Possible case definitions; inclusion and exclusion criteria

53

A3.2 Suggested inclusion criteria for cases and controls
Suggested inclusion criteria for cases and controls using several study designs are provided below.
For cases (all designs) and TND controls
• eligible to have received COVID-19 vaccine;
• admitted or presenting to health facility (outpatient/inpatient/emergency room) for acute medical
illness and meets enrolment case definition;
• underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 with a test with ≥ 85% sensitivity and ≥ 98% specificity for the
currently circulating variants;
• if applicable, able to provide informed consent (or has a proxy able to provide consent);
• specimen collected within 10 days of symptom onset.
Health facility controls
• eligible to have received COVID-19 vaccine;
• admitted or presenting to health facility for non-COVID-19 like illness:
– examples include persons hospitalized due to non-respiratory illnesses, such as urinary tract
infection, skin/soft tissue infections, trauma, surgery, obstetrics;
• no positive SARS-CoV-2 test during the current illness;
• if applicable, able to provide informed consent (or has a proxy able to provide consent).

A3.3 Potential exclusion criteria
Potential exclusion criteria are provided below. Some of these criteria help to decrease some biases but can
also introduce other biases if too many persons are excluded who meet the suspected case definition. One
can choose to exclude some persons a priori; in other instances, one may choose to conduct a sensitivity
analysis using various criteria to evaluate their influence on the results.
• Those not consenting, who decline or are unable to be interviewed by survey staff or those without
caregivers (if informed consent required by local requirements).
• Not in target group for COVID-19 vaccine (e.g. outside age range).
• If patient has a contraindication to specimen collection, specimens cannot be collected, or test results
are unavailable.
• Patients that may not be representative of the source population (e.g. patients who were transferred
from an outside facility).
• Were vaccinated with their first dose within 14 days of symptom onset (exclusion from primary analysis
but could include in secondary analyses).
• Were vaccinated with their second dose within 7–14 days of symptom onset (exclusion from primary
analysis but could include in secondary analyses).

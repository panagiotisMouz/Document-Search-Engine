Background document on the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) against COVID-19

Background
This background document has been prepared by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization Working
Group on COVID-19 Vaccines to inform the discussions of SAGE at its 21 January 2021 extraordinary meeting (1), which
resulted in the issuance of the 25 January 2021 WHO Interim recommendations for use of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine
against COVID-19.
Both recommendations and background document are available on the SAGE Covid-19
https://www.who.int/groups/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization/covid-19-materials.

webpage:

Declarations of interests were collected from all external contributors and assessed for any conflicts of interest. Summaries of
the reported interests can be found on the SAGE meeting website and SAGE Working Group website.

Methods
SAGE applies the principles of evidence-based medicine and has set in place a thorough methodological process for issuing or
updating recommendations (2). Specifically for COVID-19 vaccines, a detailed description of the methodological processes can
be found in the SAGE evidence framework for COVID-19 vaccines. This framework is intended to offer guidance for
considering data emerging from clinical trials in support of issuing vaccine-specific evidence-based recommendations (3).

General considerations on mRNA vaccines
The advantage of RNA-based vaccines is their potential for rapid development and reduced side effects. mRNA-based vaccines
avoid the risk of integration with the host cell genome and are able to produce pure viral protein. mRNA is transiently expressed,
therefore allowing protein to be made within the cell. . Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated mRNA vaccine technology allows
the delivery of precise genetic information together with an adjuvant effect to antigen-presenting cells. It is molecularly well
defined, free from materials of animal origin, and synthesized by an efficient, cell-free in vitro transcription process from DNA
templates. The technology associated with this vaccine is also capable of bypassing time-consuming standardization processes,
thus speeding up its commercial production. The fast and highly scalable mRNA manufacturing and LNP formulation processes
enable rapid production of many vaccine doses, making it suitable for rapid vaccine development and pandemic vaccine supply.

Characteristics of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273 (Moderna)
Moderna’s mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine is an LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccine expressing the prefusion-stabilized spike
glycoprotein. It was developed by Moderna and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID) in the USA.
Vaccine composition and storage
The vaccine contains a synthetic mRNA (single-stranded, 5'-capped) encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike glycoprotein (S) of
SARS-CoV-2 virus. The vaccine also contains the following ingredients: lipids (SM-102, 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG2000-DMG), cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)),
tromethamine, tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate, and sucrose. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is
supplied as a frozen suspension, at between –25 ºC and –15 ºC (–13 ºF and 5 ºF), in a multidose vial containing 10 doses.
The vaccine is a white to off-white, sterile, preservative-free frozen suspension for intramuscular injection. The vaccine must be
thawed prior to administration. After thawing, a maximum of 10 doses (0.5 ml each) can be withdrawn from each vial. Vials can
be stored refrigerated at 2–8 °C (36–46 °F) for up to 30 days prior to first use. Unopened vials may be stored at 8–25 °C (46–
77 °F) for up to 12 hours. After the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held at 2–25 °C (36–77 °F) and discarded
after 6 hours.
Vaccine dosing
The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273 (100 μg), is administered intramuscularly as a series of two doses (0.5 ml each),
given 28 days apart.

Efficacy of the Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine
Trial population
The pivotal phase 3 registration trial of the vaccine was conducted in 99 centres across the United States of America and involved
about 30 000 participants aged 18 years or older with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but whose location or
circumstances put them at appreciable risk of acquiring COVID-19 (4). Participants were healthy or had stable pre-existing
-3-

Background document on the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) against COVID-19
medical conditions. In total, 25% (7512 of 30 351) were aged 65 years or over (mean age: 70.6 years; range: 65–95 years) and
16.7% (5065 of 30 351) were under 65 years and at risk of severe COVID-19 illness (mean age: 49.0 years; range: 18–64 years).
The vaccine was administered in 2 doses separated by one month. The median age at vaccination was 51 years. Participants were
randomized equally between vaccine and placebo groups. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded. At entry
to the trial, 2.2% of participants had serological or virological evidence of a past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most were white (79%)
and similar numbers of males and females were included. The median body mass index was 28.1. The primary analysis of the
trial results was conducted when participants had been followed for a median of 64 days after the second vaccine dose; at that
time, 61% had been followed for more than 56 days.
Efficacy against COVID-19
The primary endpoint was specified as efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19, starting 14 days after the second dose, among
participants who were seronegative at trial entry. Efficacy was evaluated for those subjects who received the second dose 21-42
days after the first dose. There were 196 cases that met this definition, 11 in the vaccinated group and 185 in the placebo group.
Vaccine efficacy (VE) was estimated as 94.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 89.3–96.8%).
Analyses were also conducted including all cases from the time of the first dose. Adjusting for person–years, the VE and 95%
CI are: from dose 1 to dose 2: 84.7% (65.8–94.2%); from dose 2 to 14 days after dose 2: 100% (78.6%, NE). There was no
evidence of efficacy until approximately 14 days after the first dose.
In the period 14 or more days after the second vaccine dose, no significant variations in the estimates of vaccine efficacy were
apparent when the primary analyses were stratified according to sex, age, race and ethnic group, or for those at high risk of severe
COVID-9. In particular, among those aged 65 years or older there were 4 cases in the vaccinated group and 29 cases in the
placebo group (VE 86.4%, 95% CI 61.4–95.2%), based on a stratified Cox model.
Efficacy against severe COVID-19
A total of 30 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred in trial participants 14 or more days after the second dose, all in the placebo
group (VE=100%, 95% CI 86.9–100%; adjusting for person-years, the 95% CI is 87.0%, NE.
Summary
The vaccine was highly efficacious against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 14 days after the second vaccine dose until
the end of the follow-up period, which was, on average, about two months after the second dose. Evidence of efficacy emerged
from about 12 days after the first vaccine dose. No evidence of variation in efficacy was found in the various subgroups that
were analysed, including, importantly, those likely to be at higher risk of severe COVID-19, e.g. those over 65 years. The
estimates of efficacy were very high. Efficacy against severe COVID-19 was also very high, with all 30 cases occurring 14 or
more days after the second dose being in the placebo group.

Safety of the Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine
In the phase 3 trial, safety data were collected from 30 351 participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine (n = 15 185)
or placebo (n = 15 166). 87.9% of study participants were followed up for at least 28 days after dose 2, and the median followup time for all participants was 9 weeks after dose 2 (4).
The safety data supported a favorable safety profile. Reactogenicity symptoms, defined as solicited local injection site or
systemic reactions during the seven days after vaccination, were frequent, mostly mild to moderate and short-lived after dosing
for both adult age groups. Reactogenicity and adverse events (AEs) were generally milder and less frequent in participants in the
older group (≥65 years of age) and tended to increase in frequency and severity after the second dose.
The vaccine’s AE profile did not suggest any specific safety concerns. Severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.2–9.7% of
participants, were more frequent after dose 2 than after dose 1, and were generally less frequent in older adults (≥65 years of
age). The incidence rates of serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and discontinuations due to AEs were low and comparable
for both the vaccine and placebo groups. There were no specific safety concerns identified in subgroup analyses by age, sex,
race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at enrolment. Of note, persons with a known history of
COVID-19 were excluded from the trial. However, the trial collected nasopharyngeal swabs and serology on the day of
enrollment and some persons were positive at that time based on those results, but had no symptoms.
Adverse events
Adverse events occurring within 28 days following each vaccination were reported by 23.9% (n = 3632) of participants who
received the vaccine and 21.6% (n = 3277) of participants who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions in
participants 18 years of age and older were pain at the injection site (92.0%), fatigue (70.0%), headache (64.7%), myalgia
(61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%), chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting (23.0%), axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%),
-4-

Background document on the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) against COVID-19
swelling at the injection site (14.7%), and erythema at the injection site (10.0%). The median duration for pain was 2–3 days.
The highest rates of pain were in participants aged 18–64 years after dose 2, with 90.1% reporting any pain and 4.6% reporting
grade 3 pain. The median duration for fatigue in vaccine recipients was 2 days after any dose. The highest rates of fatigue were
reported by participants aged 18–64 years after the second dose, with 67.6% reporting any fatigue, 10.6% reporting grade 3, and
one participant reporting grade 4 (after dose 1).
Delayed localized injection site reaction with onset after 7 days was more frequent in the vaccine group than in the placebo group
and mostly occurred after the first dose.
Adverse events of special interest (that would potentially require longer follow-up)
Lymphadenopathy-related events
Lymphadenopathy-related events were reported by 173 (1.1 %) vaccine recipients and 95 (0.63 %) placebo recipients. These
events included lymphadenopathy (axillary swelling and tenderness of the vaccination arm), lymphadenitis, lymph node pain,
vaccination-site lymphadenopathy and axillary mass. These were plausibly related to vaccination.
The median duration of lymphadenopathy following any dose was 1–2 days, and fewer than 1% reported grade 3 axillary swelling
or tenderness. Lymphadenopathy was more frequently observed in participants aged 18–64 years after dose 2, with 16.0%
reporting any severity lymphadenopathy and 0.4% reporting grade 3 lymphadenopathy.
Bell’s palsy
There were three reports of Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group. In the vaccine recipients, the events
occurred 22, 28, and 32 days after dose 2. One event was a serious adverse event (reported as resolving), one case has resolved
and one is ongoing. In the placebo group, the event occurred 17 days after dose 1. Causality assessment is confounded by
predisposing factors in all the participants. The usual incidence of Bell`s palsy is 15–30 per 100 000 per year. The observed
frequency of reported Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population.
An association between COVID-19 and Bell’s palsy has been reported. Currently available information on Bell’s palsy is
insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. Surveillance for cases of Bell’s palsy with deployment of the
vaccine in larger populations is required. Bell`s palsy has been addressed in the manufacturer’s risk management plan.
Hypersensitivity-related events
A total of 233 events (1.5%) occurred in the vaccine group and 166 events (1.1%) in the placebo group. The hypersensitivityrelated events included injection site rash, injection site urticaria and maculopapular rash. There is a plausible relationship to
vaccination of these events.
No anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions with close temporal relation to the vaccine were reported during the trial.
Serious adverse events
The frequency of serious adverse events was low (1.0% in the vaccine group and 1.0% in the placebo group), without meaningful
imbalances between the two groups.
As of 3 December 2020, there had been 13 deaths in total, with 6 in the vaccine group and 7 in the placebo group. No causal
relationship was determined.
The SAEs thought to be related to the vaccine included intractable nausea and vomiting in a 65-year-old one day after the second
dose. Two subjects, who were 46 and 51 years old, reported facial swelling one and two days after the second dose, respectively.
Both subjects had prior dermal fillers.
Special populations
Pregnancies
Women were screened for pregnancy prior to each vaccination and were excluded or discontinued from vaccination if there was
a positive test. As of 2 December 2020, 13 pregnancies (6 in the vaccine group and 7 in the placebo group) had been reported.
The pregnancy outcomes in the placebo group included one spontaneous abortion and one elective abortion. The other outcomes
are not known to date and the pregnant women are being followed.
A combined developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproductive toxicity study of the vaccine in rats concluded that the vaccine
at a dose of 100 μg, given prior to mating and during gestation periods, did not have any adverse effects (including on female
reproduction, fetal/embryonal development, or postnatal development).

Summary
The safety data supported a favourable safety profile. Reactogenicity was mostly mild to moderate, less frequent and severe in
adults aged 65 years and over than in younger adults and generally more frequent after the second dose in both age groups. No
safety concerns were identified in subgroup analyses by age, sex, race, ethnicity, comorbidities and health risks for severe
COVID-19.
Delayed localized injection site reaction with onset after 7 days was more frequent in the vaccine group than in the placebo group
and mostly seen after the first dose.
Lymphadenopathy-related events were more frequent in the vaccine group than the placebo group and were plausibly related to
vaccination. Hypersensitivity-related events were more frequent in the vaccine group than the placebo group. No anaphylactic
or severe hypersensitivity reactions with temporal relation to vaccination were reported during the trial. Three cases of Bell’s
palsy were reported in vaccine recipients, and one in placebo recipients. Although there is no clear basis upon which to conclude
a causal relationship at this time, further surveillance for Bell’s palsy is required as part of the risk management plan.

BENEFITS & HARMS OF THE OPTIONS

PROBLEM

Background: On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The cause was found to be a novel
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The disease caused by this novel virus has been named COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern
in January 2020. The disease has since spread, with an enormous impact on the health and well-being of individuals and populations worldwide. It has further caused major disruptions to
various sectors of society and the economy across the globe.

RESEARCH EVIDENCE

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases
globally has surpassed 88 828 387 with more than
1 926 635 deaths. Cases have been found in 190
different countries or territories throughout the
world (status 11 January 2021). There has been
collateral damage to other public health
programmes.

The COVID-19 situation is evolving rapidly; the
most recent epidemiological situation can be
found on the following website:

Primary efficacy analysis shows that mRNA-1273
vaccine is 95.6% efficacious (95%CI: 90.6–97.9%)
in individuals aged 18–64 years against COVID-19
beginning 14 days after the second dose (1, 2).

Phase 1 trial data showed seroconversion of all
participants by day 15, independent of dosage
used. The study showed immunogenicity of the
mRNA-1273 vaccine, binding antibody IgG
concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
titres in sera increased with dose level (25, 100
and 250 μg) and after a second dose. Further, two
doses of either 25 or 100 μg of mRNA-1273
vaccine elicited a robust CD4+ T-cell response.
CD8+ T-cell responses were elicited at low levels
after the second dose in the 100 μg group (3).

https://covid19.who.int/table

A phase 2a trial showed that the immune
response, as assessed by binding antibody IgG
and neutralizing antibodies after 2 doses, were
comparable in the two groups assessed (50 μg
and 100 μg) (1).

Data from over 30 420 participants demonstrate

group than in the placebo group after both the first
dose (8320/15 168 (54.9%) vs 6399/15 155
(42.2%)) and the second dose (11 652/14 677
(79.4%) vs. 5323/14 566 (36.5%)), with severity
increasing after the second dose. Both solicited
injection-site and systemic adverse events were
more common among younger participants (18–
64 years of age) than among older participants
(≥65 years of age).
The frequency of grade 3 adverse events in the
placebo group (202/15 166 (1.3%)) was similar to
that in the vaccine group (234/15 185 (1.5%)), as
were the frequencies of medically attended

Available scientific evidence on the relative
importance of the intervention, as well as the
relative weights that the target population
attributes to the desirable (i.e. protection conferred
by the vaccine) and the undesirable outcomes (i.e.
the currently reported safety signals), vary.
There may also be variability around acceptance
of novel product platforms for mRNA vaccines,
which may represent a source of
uncertainty/variability.
Different population groups may have different
opinions regarding the weights assigned to
desirable and undesirable outcomes.
Available scientific evidence suggests that target
population probably assigns more weight to the
desirable effects than to the undesirable effects
related to COVID-19 vaccination in general.
Targeted information campaigns should
assess this aspect.

Considerable resources will be needed to ensure
the implementation of a COVID-19 vaccination
programme, especially given: (i) that COVID-19
vaccination is likely to be prioritized for populations
(e.g. health care workers, older adults) without
pre-existing robust immunization programmes in
many settings, and (ii) the urgency of vaccination
roll-out worldwide, which may necessitate
additional surge resources to accelerate
implementation with adequate infection prevention
and control procedures in the context of COVID19. Resources required include, but are not
restricted to, human resources, vaccine costs,
logistics, cold-chain capacity, planning and
coordination, training, social mobilization and
communications, and immunization safety
surveillance.

An estimated US$15.9 billion is needed for the
vaccines pillar (COVAX) of the Access to COVID19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) for 2020–21, in
order to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021.
This does not include all delivery costs in all
countries participating in COVAX, bilateral
procurement deals, or research and development
investments outside of COVAX (6). The World
Bank has approved a financing window of up to
US$12 billion to support low- and middle-income
countries in purchasing and distributing vaccine
(7).

Formal global cost-effectiveness analyses have
not been conducted, but the emerging evidence
indicates that the benefits, including the impact on
recovery of the global economy, are likely to
outweigh the cost of COVID-19 vaccination in
general. Cost-effectiveness analyses should be
conducted at country level; cost-effectiveness of
COVID-19 vaccination may vary by country
depending on COVID-19 burden, comparator
interventions assessed, analysis perspective, and
local cost-effectiveness thresholds used.

The global economy is estimated to be losing
US$375 billion per month due to the coronavirus
pandemic. G20 countries have invested
approximately US$10 trillion in domestic
economic stimulus to mitigate the economic
consequences of reduced business activity and
unemployment due to the pandemic. Initial
estimates suggest that COVID-19 vaccination will
provide substantial economic value in terms of
averted morbidity and mortality costs and averted
losses in gross domestic product (GDP) (6, 8–13).

Equity and ethical considerations are critical.
SAGE has produced a Values Framework (14),
which offers guidance on the fair allocation of
COVID-19 vaccines based on six core ethical
principles that should guide distribution. If
distributed fairly, COVID-19 vaccines may have
considerable impact on reducing health inequities.

Vaccine nationalism is seen as a threat to
reducing health inequity, in particular as highincome countries have arranged bilateral
contracts with manufacturers. This has led to the
establishment of the Access to COVID-19 Tools
(ACT) Accelerator and within this, the COVAX
facility, which aims to ensure equitable access to
vaccines for its participating member states, most
of whom do not have bilateral contracts (15).

mRNA-1273 vaccine needs to be stored and
distributed at –20 °C. Once thawed, it can be kept
in a refrigerator for up to 30 days. This requirement
is not shared by many other vaccine platforms.
-17-

Background document on the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) against COVID-19

This cold-chain capacity is not currently available
in many low- and middle-income-countries, and in
some regions of high-income countries,
particularly in hard-to-reach or otherwise already
disadvantaged communities. If other vaccines with
less demanding storage requirements are not
made available, or if vaccines that are feasible and
available to deliver are less efficacious or less
safe, health inequities will result and existing
health inequities may be exacerbated.

The fact that 190 economies are participating in
COVAX suggests a very high acceptability of
COVID-19 vaccination in general, though not
necessarily of this vaccine in particular.

Vaccine acceptability varies between (sub-)
population groups and may be correlated with the
perceived risk posed by the disease. In a global
survey (19 countries) of acceptance rates in the
general population of any COVID-19 vaccine
product, 71.5% of participants reported that they
would be very or somewhat likely to take a COVID19 vaccine. Acceptance rates ranged from almost
55% to 87% (16). Acceptability of COVID-19
vaccination is currently being assessed in
international polls (www.yougov.co.uk and
www.ipsos.com).

WHO has worked with an external expert group to
develop tools to understand the intentions of the
general public with regard to being vaccinated
against COVID-19. The survey and interview
guides are targeted towards populations
prioritized for COVID-19 vaccines: adults and
health workers. Gathering and using quality data
on the behavioural and social drivers of
vaccination will allow programmes to design,
target and evaluate interventions to achieve
greater impact with more efficiency, and to
examine trends over time. The tools measure four
domains that influence vaccine uptake: what
people think and feel about vaccines; social
processes that drive or inhibit vaccination;
individual motivations (or hesitancy) to seek
vaccination; and practical factors involved in
seeking and receiving vaccination. Assessing all
domains will allow more comprehensive planning
and evaluation. Publication is expected
imminently.

Cold-chain requirements and logistics may not be

The combination of the product’s logistic features
and its reactogenicity makes mass workplace
vaccination, which will be intended for this vaccine
in many settings, more difficult. In particular, if
many health workers are vaccinated at the same
time, several may be unable to work the next day

responses.

Recommendation (text)

Vaccination with mRNA-1273 is recommended in persons aged 18 and above. The recommended schedule is two doses (100 µg, 0.5 ml each) given
intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle. An interval of 28 days between the doses is recommended. If the second dose is inadvertently administered less
than 28 days after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is inadvertently delayed it should be given as
soon as possible thereafter, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. It is currently recommended that individuals receive no more than two doses in
total.

Implementation considerations

Before implementation, countries should consider whether they have adequate logistic and cold-chain capacity in place to ensure vaccine distribution and
administration under the mentioned requirements. In countries where various immunization stakeholders have a crucial role in vaccine distribution,
information and open discussion will be required before the vaccine is deployed.

WHO recommends the following post-authorization monitoring activities:
vaccine effectiveness over time;
ongoing collection of safety data in vaccine recipients;
surveillance for COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals, looking for vaccine-induced enhanced disease (possibly as vaccine-induced antibody
levels decline);
• safety data from inadvertently vaccinated pregnant women during trials and post-authorization;
• safety data from pregnant women who receive vaccine because they are members of prioritized groups, e.g. health workers;
• prospective studies on the safety of mRNA-1273 in pregnant women;
• impact on infants of vaccination of breastfeeding mothers;
• safety data on vaccination in immunocompromised persons, including persons living with HIV and persons with autoimmune disease;
• impact of delayed second dose as currently implemented by certain countries.

coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The disease caused by this novel virus has been named COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern
in January 2020. The disease has since spread with an enormous impact on the health and well-being of individuals and populations worldwide. It has further caused major disruptions to
various sectors of society and the economy across the globe.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases globally
has surpassed 88 828 387 with more than 1 926 635
deaths. Cases have been found in 190 different
countries or territories throughout the world (status 11
January 2021). There has been collateral damage to
other public health programmes.

The COVID-19 situation is evolving rapidly; the
most recent epidemiological situation can be found
on the following website:

Older adults are particularly affected by COVID-19
and bear a significantly higher risk of severe COVID19 outcomes and death.

Of the trial participants, approximately 25% were aged
65 years or older.
Primary efficacy analysis shows that mRNA-1273 is
86.4% efficacious (95%CI: 61.4–95.2%) in individuals
aged 65 years and older.

Primary efficacy analysis shows that mRNA-1273
vaccine is 95.6% efficacious (95%CI: 90.6–97.9%) in
individuals aged 18–64 years against COVID-19
beginning 14 days after the second dose.(1, 2)

Phase 1 trial data showed seroconversion of all
participants by day 15, independent of dosage used.
The study showed immunogenicity of the mRNA1273 vaccine; binding antibody IgG concentrations
and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titres in sera increased
with dose level (25, 100 and 250 μg) and after a
second dose. Further, two doses of either 25 or 100
μg of mRNA-1273 vaccine elicited robust CD4+ Tcell response. CD8+ T-cell responses were elicited at
low levels after the second dose in the 100 μg group
(3).

The majority of severe disease occurs in older
individuals. Available scientific evidence suggests that
the target population probably considers the desirable
effects, i.e. the protection conferred by the vaccine,
more important than the undesirable effects, i.e. the
currently reported safety signals related to COVID-19
vaccination.
There may also be variability around acceptance of
novel product platforms for mRNA vaccines, which
may represent a source of uncertainty/variability.
Different population groups may have different
opinions regarding the weights assigned to desirable
and undesirable outcomes.
Available scientific evidence suggests that the target
population probably assigns more weight to the
desirable effects than the undesirable effects related
to COVID-19 vaccination.
Targeted information campaigns should assess this
aspect.

Considerable resources will be needed to ensure the
implementation of a COVID-19 vaccination
programme, especially given: (i) that COVID-19
vaccination is likely to be prioritized for populations
(e.g. health care workers, older adults) without preexisting robust immunization programmes in many
settings, and (ii) the urgency of vaccination roll-out
worldwide, which may necessitate additional surge
resources to accelerate implementation with adequate
infection prevention and control procedures in the
context of COVID-19. Resources required include, but
are not restricted to, human resources, vaccine costs,
logistics, cold-chain capacity, planning and
coordination, training, social mobilization and
communications,
and
immunization
safety
surveillance.

An estimated US$15.9 billion is needed for the
vaccines pillar (COVAX) of the Access to COVID19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) for 2020–21, in
order to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021.
This does not include all delivery costs in all
countries participating in COVAX, bilateral
procurement deals, or research and development
investments outside of COVAX (6).

Formal global cost-effectiveness analyses have not
been conducted, but the emerging evidence indicates
that the benefits, including the impact on recovery of
the global economy, are likely to outweigh the cost of
COVID-19 vaccination in general. Cost-effectiveness
analyses should be conducted at country level; costeffectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination may vary by
country depending on COVID-19 burden, comparator
interventions assessed, analysis perspective, and
local cost-effectiveness thresholds used.

The global economy is estimated to be losing
US$375 billion per month due to the coronavirus
pandemic.
G20 countries have invested
approximately US$10 trillion in domestic economic
stimulus to mitigate the economic consequences
of reduced business activity and unemployment
due to the pandemic. Initial estimates suggest that
COVID-19 vaccination will provide substantial
economic value in terms of averted morbidity and
mortality costs and averted GDP losses (6, 8–13).

Equity and ethical considerations are critical. SAGE
has produced a Values Framework (14), which offers
guidance on the fair allocation of COVID-19 vaccines
based on six core ethical principles that should guide
distribution. If distributed fairly, COVID-19 vaccines
may have considerable impact on reducing health
inequities.

Vaccine nationalism is seen as a threat to reducing
health inequity, in particular as high-income
countries have arranged bilateral contracts with
manufacturers. This has led to the establishment
of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT)
Accelerator and, within this, the COVAX facility,
which aims to ensure equitable access to vaccines
for its participating member states, most of whom
do not have bilateral contracts (15).

mRNA-1273 vaccine needs to be stored and
distributed at –20 °C. This requirement is not shared
by many other vaccine platforms. Once thawed, it can
be kept in a refrigerator for up to 30 days.
-25-

The World Bank has approved a financing window
of up to US $12 billion to support low- and middleincome countries in purchasing and distributing
vaccine (7).

Background document on the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) against COVID-19

This cold-chain capacity is not currently available in
many low- and middle-income-countries, and in some
regions of high-income countries, particularly in hardto-reach or otherwise already disadvantaged
communities. If other vaccines with less demanding
storage requirements are not made available, or if
vaccines that are feasible and available to deliver are
less efficacious or less safe, health inequities will
result and existing health inequities may be
exacerbated.

No scientific evidence is available. As vaccination is
an eagerly awaited tool to combat the COVID-19
pandemic, it is assumed that key stakeholders, in
particular ministries of health and immunization
managers, are strongly in favour of COVID-19
vaccination.

The fact that 190 economies are participating in
COVAX suggests a very high acceptability of
COVID-19 vaccination in general, though not
necessarily of this vaccine in particular.

Vaccine acceptability varies between (sub-)
population groups, and may be correlated with the
perceived risk posed by the disease. In a global survey
(19 countries) of acceptance rates in the general
population of any COVID-19 vaccine product, 71.5%
of participants reported that they would be very or
somewhat likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine.
Acceptance rates ranged from almost 55% to 87%
(16).

WHO has worked with an external expert group to
develop tools to understand the intentions of the
general public with regard to being vaccinated against
COVID-19. The survey and interview guides are
targeted towards populations prioritized for COVID-19
vaccines: adults and health workers. Gathering and
using quality data on the behavioural and social
drivers of vaccination will allow programmes to
design, target and evaluate interventions to achieve
greater impact with more efficiency, and to examine
trends over time. The tools measure four domains
that influence vaccine uptake: what people think and
feel about vaccines; social processes that drive or
inhibit vaccination; individual motivations (or
hesitancy) to seek vaccination; and practical factors
involved in seeking and receiving vaccination.

Acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination is currently
being
assessed
in
international
polls
(www.yougov.co.uk and www.ipsos.com).

Recommendation (text)

The risk of severe COVID-19 and death increases steeply with age. Data from the phase 3 trial indicate that the efficacy and safety
of the vaccine are comparable across all age groups (above the age of 18). Vaccination is recommended for older persons. Extremely frail older persons and
persons above the age of 95 years were not included in the clinical trials. However, the safety and immunogenicity data obtained in a large subset of older
people with and without comorbidities suggest that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks. Vaccination is recommended for older persons
without an upper age limit. For very frail older persons with a life expectancy anticipated to be less than 3 months, an individual risk–benefit assessment will
need to be conducted.

Implementation
considerations

Before implementation, countries should consider whether they have adequate logistic and cold-chain capacity in place to ensure vaccine distribution and
administration under the mentioned requirements. In the countries where various immunization stakeholders have a crucial role in vaccine distribution,
information and open discussion will be required before the vaccine is deployed.

There is possibly important uncertainty related to
the target population weighing of desirable and
undesirable effects ( i.e. the protection conferred
by the vaccine weighed against the currently
reported safety signals) related to COVID-19
vaccination.
There may also be variability around acceptance
of novel product platforms for mRNA vaccines,
which
may
represent
a
source
of
uncertainty/variability.
Different population groups may have different
opinions regarding the relative weights attributed
to desirable and undesirable outcomes

Available scientific evidence suggests that the
target population probably attached more weight
to the desirable effects than the undesirable
effects related to COVID-19 vaccination in
general.
Targeted information campaigns should assess
this aspect.
Considerable resources will be needed to ensure the
implementation of a COVID-19 vaccination
programme, especially given: (i) that COVID-19
vaccination is likely to be prioritized for populations
(e.g. health care workers, older adults) without preexisting robust immunization programmes in many
settings, and (ii) the urgency of vaccination roll-out
worldwide, which may necessitate additional surge
resources to accelerate implementation with
adequate infection prevention and control
procedures in the context of COVID-19. Resources
required include, but are not restricted to: human
resources, vaccine costs, logistics, cold-chain
capacity, planning and coordination, training, social
mobilization
and
communications,
and
immunization safety surveillance.

An estimated US$15.9 billion is
needed for the vaccines pillar
(COVAX) of the Access to COVID19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) for
2020–21, in order to deliver 2 billion
vaccine doses by the end of 2021. This
does not include all delivery costs in all
countries participating in COVAX,
bilateral procurement deals, or
research and development investments
outside of COVAX (6).

Formal global cost-effectiveness analyses have
not been conducted, but the emerging evidence
indicates that the benefits, including the impact
on recovery of the global economy, are likely to
outweigh the cost of COVID-19 vaccination in
general. Cost-effectiveness analyses should be
conducted at country level; cost-effectiveness of
COVID-19 vaccination may vary by country
depending on COVID-19 burden, comparator
interventions assessed, analysis perspective, and
local cost-effectiveness thresholds used.

The global economy is estimated to be
losing US$375 billion per month due
to the coronavirus pandemic. G20
countries have invested approximately
US$10 trillion in domestic economic
stimulus to mitigate the economic
consequences of reduced business
activity and unemployment due to the
pandemic. Initial estimates suggest
that COVID-19 vaccination will
provide substantial economic value in
terms of averted morbidity and
mortality costs and averted GDP
losses (6, 8-13).

The World Bank has approved a
financing window of up to US$12
billion to support low- and middleincome countries in purchasing and
distributing vaccine (7).

Equity and ethical considerations are critical.
SAGE has produced a Values Framework (14),
which offers guidance on the fair allocation of
COVID-19 vaccines based on six core ethical
principles that should guide distribution. If
distributed fairly, COVID-19 vaccines may have
considerable impact on reducing health
inequities.
mRNA-1273 vaccine needs to be stored and
distributed at –20 °C. This requirement is not
shared by many other vaccine platforms. Once
thawed, it can be kept in a refrigerator for up to
30 days.

Vaccine nationalism is seen as a
threat to reducing health inequity, in
particular as high-income countries
have arranged bilateral contracts
with manufacturers. This has led to
the establishment of the Access to
Tools
(ACT)
COVID-19
Accelerator and, within this, the
COVAX facility, which aims to
ensure equitable access to vaccines
for its participating member states
most of whom do not have bilateral
contracts (15).

This cold-chain capacity is not currently
available in many low- and middle-income
countries, and in some regions of high-income
countries, particularly in hard-to-reach or
otherwise already disadvantaged communities. If
other vaccines with less demanding storage
requirements are not made available, or if
vaccines that are feasible and available to deliver
are less efficacious or less safe, health inequities
will result and existing health inequities may be
exacerbated.
No scientific evidence is available. As
vaccination is an eagerly awaited tool to combat
the COVID-19 pandemic, it is assumed that key
stakeholders, in particular ministries of health
and immunization managers, are strongly in
favour of COVID-19 vaccination.

The fact that 190 economies are
participating in COVAX suggests a
very high acceptability of COVID19 vaccination in general, though not
necessarily of this vaccine in
particular.

Vaccine acceptability varies between (sub-)
population groups, and may be correlated with
the perceived risk posed by the disease. In a
global survey (19 countries) on acceptance rates

WHO has worked with an external
expert group to develop tools to
understand the intentions of the
general public with regard to being

-35-

Background document on the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) against COVID-19
in the general population of any COVID-19
vaccine product, 71.5% of participants reported
that they would be very or somewhat likely to
take a COVID-19 vaccine. Acceptance rates
ranged from almost 55% to 87% (16).
Acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination is
currently being assessed by international polls
(www.yougov.co.uk and www.ipsos.com).

vaccinated against COVID-19. The

adults and health workers. Gathering
and using quality data on the

vaccination will enable programmes to

interventions to achieve greater impact
with more efficiency, and to examine
trends over time. The tools measure
four domains that influence vaccine
uptake: what people think and feel
about vaccines; social processes that
drive or inhibit vaccination; individual
motivations (or hesitancy) to seek
vaccination; and practical factors
involved in seeking and receiving
vaccination. Assessing all domains
will allow more comprehensive
planning and evaluation. Publication is
expected imminently.

Cold-chain requirements and logistics may not
be available in all settings, in particular in lowand middle-income-countries, and are expensive

☒ Only with targeted monitoring and evaluation

Persons with comorbidities
Certain comorbidities have been identified as increasing the risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death. The Cove Phase 3 clinical
trial demonstrated that the vaccine has similar safety and efficacy profiles in persons with various underlying medical conditions,
including those that place them at increased risk for severe COVID-19. The comorbidities studied in in the Cove Phase 3 clinical trial
included chronic lung disease, significant cardiac disease, severe obesity, diabetes, liver disease and HIV infection. Vaccination is
recommended for persons with such comorbidities that have been identified as increasing the risk of severe COVID-19.
Immunocompromised persons

Recommendation (text)

Immunocompromised persons are at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Available data are currently insufficient to assess vaccine
efficacy or vaccine-associated risks in severely immunocompromised persons. It is possible that the immune response to the vaccine
may be reduced, which may alter its effectiveness. In the interim, given that the vaccine is not a live virus, immunocompromised
persons who are part of a group recommended for vaccination may be vaccinated. Information and, where possible, counselling about
vaccine safety and efficacy profiles in immunocompromised persons should be provided to inform individual benefit–risk assessment.
Pregnant women
Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 than women of childbearing age who are not pregnant, and COVID-19 has
been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. The available data on mRNA-1273 vaccination of pregnant women are
insufficient to assess vaccine efficacy or vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. However, it should be noted that the mRNA-1273
vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, and the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell and is degraded quickly.
Developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART) studies in animals have not shown harmful effects in pregnancy. Further studies
are planned in pregnant women in the coming months. As data from these studies become available, recommendations on vaccination
will be updated accordingly. In the interim, WHO recommends not to use mRNA-1273 in pregnancy, unless the benefit of vaccinating
a pregnant woman outweighs the potential vaccine risks, such as in health workers at high risk of exposure and pregnant women with
comorbidities placing them in a high-risk group for severe COVID-19. Information and, if possible, counselling on the lack of safety
and efficacy data for pregnant women should be provided.

Background document on the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) against COVID-19

WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy because of
vaccination.
Persons living with HIV
Persons living with HIV may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Among the phase 3 clinical trial participants with well controlled
HIV, there were no reported differences in safety signals. HIV-positive persons who are well controlled on highly active antiretroviral
therapy and are part of a group recommended for vaccination can be vaccinated. Available data on administration of the vaccine are
currently insufficient to allow assessment of vaccine efficacy or safety for persons living with HIV who are not well controlled on
therapy. It is possible that the immune response to the vaccine may be reduced, which may alter its effectiveness. In the interim, given
that the vaccine is not a live virus, persons living with HIV who are part of a group recommended for vaccination may be vaccinated.
Information and, where possible, counselling about vaccine safety and efficacy profiles in immunocompromised persons should be
provided to inform individual benefit–risk assessment. It is not necessary to test for HIV infection prior to vaccine administration.
Persons with autoimmune conditions
No data are currently available on the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1273 in persons with autoimmune conditions, although these
persons were eligible for enrolment in the clinical trials. Persons with autoimmune conditions who have no contraindications to
vaccination may be vaccinated.
Implementation
considerations

Before implementation, countries should consider whether they have adequate logistic and cold-chain capacity in place to ensure
vaccine distribution and administration under the mentioned requirements. In the countries where various immunization stakeholders
have a crucial role in the vaccine distribution, information and open discussion will be required before the vaccine is deployed.
WHO recommends the following post-authorization monitoring activities:
•
•
•

Monitoring and evaluation

•
•
•
•
•
•

vaccine effectiveness over time;
ongoing collection of safety data in vaccine recipients;
surveillance for COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals, looking for vaccine-induced enhanced disease (possibly as
vaccine-induced antibody levels decline);
safety data from inadvertently vaccinated pregnant women during trials and post-authorization;
safety data from pregnant women who receive vaccine because they are members of prioritized groups, e.g. health workers;
prospective studies on the safety of mRNA-1273 in pregnant women;
impact on infants of vaccination of breastfeeding mothers;
safety data on vaccination in immunocompromised persons, including persons living with HIV and persons with autoimmune
disease;
impact of delayed second dose as currently implemented by certain countries.

•
•

immunogenicity and safety studies of co-administration with other vaccines, including influenza and pneumococcal
vaccines, to adults and older persons;
studies to demonstrate whether this vaccine reduces SARS-CoV-2 transmission and viral shedding;
clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of vaccination of children below the age of 18 years;
stability of vaccine under alternative cold-chain distribution and storage conditions;
effectiveness of the proposed strategies for the prevention and management of anaphylactic reactions;
interchangeability and “mix and match” studies within and across COVID-19 vaccine platforms;
global surveillance of virus evolution and the impact of virus mutants on vaccine effectiveness to support possible update of
vaccines if needed;
head-to-head studies with other vaccines on extent and duration of immunity using standardized neutralization assays and
mucosal immunity assays.

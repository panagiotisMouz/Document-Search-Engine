a b s t r a c t
COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic. The course and management of the disease in the liver transplant
setting may be difﬁcult due to a long-standing immunosuppressive state. In Egypt, the only available
option is living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). In our centre, we have transplanted 440 livers since
2008. In this study, we report a single-centre experience with COVID-19 infection in long-term liver
transplant recipients. A total of 25 recipients (5.7 %) had COVID-19 infections since March 2020. Among
these recipients, two developed COVID-19 infections twice, approximately three and two months apart,
respectively.

1. Background
COVID-19 is a novel viral infection pandemic of international
concern. The emerging virus has affected more than 30 million
people in the 6 months since its initial identiﬁcation [1]. Liver
transplant recipients are under long-term immunosuppression and
are considered one of the most vulnerable groups for COVID-19
infection. However, data regarding the course and outcome of the
disease in organ transplantation recipients are scarce.
2. Case report
During the current pandemic, our centre continued to follow up
post-transplant recipients using telemedicine or hospital visits as
needed. Any cases with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 infection were referred to our hospital triage and underwent routine
work-ups, including measures of chest CT, CBC, CRP, serum ferritin,
D-dimer, serum creatinine, ABG, and liver function. In this study,
we report 2 cases of COVID-19 reinfection in liver transplant recipients. In both cases, the patients were discharged from the hospital
after the ﬁrst infection episode when the results of two successive
COVID-19 PCR tests 48−72 h apart were negative.

The ﬁrst case, a 49-year-old male, was transplanted on December 2019 due to cryptogenic cirrhosis. In both instances of
COVID-19 infection, he was completely asymptomatic and was discovered to be COVID-19-positive by a nasopharyngeal swab taken
during a routine work-up before ERCP for biliary problems. The ﬁrst
bout of COVID-19 infection was on 11 May 2020, and the second
was on 17 August 2020 (96 days apart) (Figs. 1–3). The laboratory
data are summarized in Table 1.
The other case, a 61-year-old male, underwent LDLT in December 2017 due to HCV-related cirrhosis. After COVID infection, this
patient presented with severe respiratory symptoms, fever, and
acute kidney injury (AKI). The ﬁrst bout of COVID-19 infection was
on 13 June 2020, and the second was on 7 August 2020 (<2 months
apart). The patient presented with COVID-19 infection with highgrade fever, cough, dyspnoea, diarrhoea and hypotension (second
attack). He was admitted to intermediate care with a diagnosis of
COVID-19 and sepsis.
Both patients were admitted to an isolation hospital and
received symptomatic treatment according to their clinical conditions, with temporary MMF suspension in both cases and
temporary cyclosporine suspension in the second case due to
severe sepsis and acute kidney injury. Both patients responded well
to symptomatic treatment. The ﬁrst case had a negative nasopharyngeal swab as measured by PCR and was discharged from the
hospital 48 h later and resumed taking his usual immunosuppressant drugs.

and the base of the left lower lung lobe. No pulmonary nodules,
lymph nodes, or pleural effusion were detected (Fig. 4). His renal
function returned to normal baseline after ﬂuid therapy and symptomatic treatment. He did not require dialysis.
According to the National Ministry of Health protocol, the
patients received oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BID for 24 h,
then 200 mg BID), oseltamivir (75 mg BID) the ﬁrst time (this was
subsequently removed from the national guidelines), azithromycin
(500 mg QD; plus imipenem in the second case) and prophylactic
anticoagulation with enoxaparin (40 mg QD).Neither case required
ICU admission or mechanical ventilation.

The second case was more severe, with lung and kidney infection. ABG showed metabolic acidosis, serum creatinine of 7 mg/dl,
and potassium of 6 mg/dl (Table 2). The patient required 11 days
of hospitalization. His chest CT showed multiple bilateral peripheral variable-sized ground glass opacities involving both lung lobes.
Multiple consolidation opacities were observed in both the lingula

3. Discussion
In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China [2], and subsequently became a global pandemic.

This novel virus was named by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3].
The pathological features of COVID-19 are not yet well understood, but the data suggest similarities to those observed in severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory
syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infections [4].
Tissue damage after SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated either
by a direct virus-induced cytopathogenic effect or through an
immune-mediated inﬂammatory response. [5]
Recent studies on COVID-19 have reported that the incidence
of liver injury ranges from 14.8%–53% [6]. These percentages raise
concerns regarding liver transplant recipients: are they more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their immunosuppressive
state? If they are infected, is the transplanted liver at risk? Data from
different liver transplant centres are scarce, and there is no consensus on managing the disease with immunosuppressant drugs.
To date, there have been no speciﬁc recommendations in terms of
the course or management of liver transplant patients from major
societies.
During the pandemic, the Ministry of Health in Egypt increased
medical health service capacity and assigned 23 hospitals to manage COVID-19 in each governorate as quarantine hospitals [7]. Ain
Shams University Hospital (ASCOT) temporarily held an LDLT programme from 2 March to 13 July 2020. Most government and
university centres have temporarily discontinued transplant activities based on an unacceptable donor risk, uncertain data on the
impact of COVID-19 on recipients, and to reserve resources to manage the pandemic [7]. At our centre, although operations were
temporarily restricted, outpatient clinics and follow-up continued.
Our staff followed up recipients using telemedicine and/or hospital visits as needed. This may explain the relatively higher number
of patients we treated with COVID-19 infection compared to other
centres in Egypt that completely suspended their activities or were
serving as isolation hospitals.
Overall, our patients’ clinical characteristics (symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to those of other
non-transplant adult patients with COVID-19. Twenty-ﬁve patients
presented to the Ain Shams Center for Organ Transplantation
(ASCOT) with fever (96 %), dry cough (78 %), and loss of smell and
taste (22 %). This symptomology was consistent with the empirical
data and some publications that reported these COVID-19 symptoms [8,9].
Managing immunosuppression is crucial in these cases. Our
centre had mild cases (92 %), and we did not decrease or suspend the usual CNI doses with temporary suspension of MMF.
Three patients required ICU admission with complete suspension of CNI and MMF and started methylprednisolone at 1

mg/kg/day for 3–5 days. No patients required mechanical ventilation.
In a report from Italy, three COVID-19-related diseases occurred
at an Italian transplant centre in Lombardy. They were long-term
patients on minimal immunosuppressive regimens, not recent
transplant recipients or fully immunosuppressed patients [10].
In contrast to the report of Bhoori et al., other cohort deaths
included four patients transplanted within the past 2 years. Among
the patients who died, four (44 %) had diabetes, four (44 %) had
hypertension, and three (33 %) had obesity. Although the numbers
were low, the frequencies of these comorbidities were not significantly different between the fatal and nonfatal COVID-19 cases.
The authors recommend that those caring for patients with previous liver transplantation and other forms of chronic liver disease
use registries to pool details on COVID-19 cases to permit rapid
large-scale collaborative analyses that are required to inform clinical care [11]. In 2020, Zhang et al. claimed that, although early data
suggest that the effects of COVID-19 on the liver might be modest and be similar to the infection severity among patients without
pre-existing liver disease, the effects of COVID-19 on those with
liver transplants or established liver disease remain unclear [12].
Notably, reinfection occurred after 3 months in the ﬁrst patient
and after 55 days in the second patient after primary infection,
although both patients were discharged from the hospital after
2 successive COVID-19 negative tests by PCR following the ﬁrst
COVID-19 infection. To date, reports of reinfection have been infrequent. The risk of reinfection may be lower in the ﬁrst 3 months
after initial infection, according to limited evidence from another
beta-coronavirus (HCoV-OC43), the genus to which SARS-CoV-2
belongs. Similar to other human coronaviruses for which studies have demonstrated reinfection, the probability of SARS-CoV-2
reinfection is expected to increase with time after recovery from
initial infection due to waning immunity and possible genetic drift
[13–16].
The degree of protective immunity conferred by infection with
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
currently unknown. The possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2
is not well understood [17]. To date, no reported cases of COVID-19
reinfection in the post-transplant setting have been published.
On the other hand, Li Anchoret al., 2020 reported that 36 of 378
patients had COVID-19 RNA shedding longer than 30 days. SARS
COV IgM & IgG levels remained persistently high in these patients
even to the ninth week. They postulated that the high levels of
IgM indicated the duration of viral infection and may be related to
prolonged viral RNA shedding [15].
Akiko Iwasaki commented on the four published cases of reinfection in the general population (as of the writing of this report).
It is important to keep in mind that reinfection cases are being tab-

ulated because of symptoms and are biased towards the detection
of symptomatic cases. Asymptomatic reinfection cases can only
be identiﬁed by routine community testing or at an airport, and
the number of asymptomatic reinfections is probably signiﬁcantly
underestimated [18].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of COVID19 reinfection in liver transplantation recipients in Africa and the
Middle East. COVID-19 reinfection can occur in liver transplant
recipients with varying severity. In this paper, we recorded two
cases of COVID-19 reinfection in liver transplant recipients with
good outcomes. This could add to reference cases for managing
these cases but cannot be extrapolated to other of cases in which
different immunosuppression regimens are used. Why do some
reinfections result in milder disease, whereas others are more
severe? The question remains unanswered.

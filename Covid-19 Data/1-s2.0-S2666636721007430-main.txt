Running Head: COVID-19 Cliff Notes

Abstract: As we pass the nearly 9 month mark of the coronavirus virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic in the United States, we sought to compile a brief multi-disciplinary compendium of COVID19 information learned to date. COVID-19 is an active viral pandemic caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that confers high morbidity and mortality. COVID19 has been associated with: pulmonary compromise and acute respiratory distress syndrome,
thrombotic events, inflammation and cytokine, and post-infectious syndromes. Mitigation of these
complications and expeditious therapy are a global urgency; this is brief summary of current data and
management approaches synthesized from publications, experience, cross-disciplinary expertise (Figure
1).
Pulmonary and supportive care: Progressive COVID-19 requires critical care. Priorities include:
appropriate personal protective equipment, negative pressure rooms and minimization of particle
aerosolization: regular or high flow nasal cannula (limited to ≤30 liters/minute), oxygen mask, and in
very select cases a trial of non-invasive ventilation.1 Progressive failure necessitates safe endotracheal
intubation by experienced providers and lung-protective mechanical ventilation (high positive end
expiratory pressure and low tidal volumes), with adjunct therapies including: proning, inhaled
pulmonary vasodilators, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, vasopressors, nutrition, and renal
replacement therapy. Safe and expedient extubation must be prioritized in patients with successful
spontaneous breathing trials1. Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening
complication, with data suggesting low dose, short term, dexamethasone may have a critical role. 2
Cardiac complications are increasingly recognized in COVID-19, including myocarditis, heart failure,
arrhythmia; thus, cardiac evaluation is recommended in children and adults with severe disease.
Additional risks of ulcers, thrombi, and fluid overload should be minimized. Evaluation for co-infections
is warranted, as data have shown that bacterial and fungal pathogens contribute to mortality, and some
suggest empiric anti-microbials.1

COVID-19 Treatments: Two therapies continue to show promise for primary treatment of COVID-19.
Convalescent plasma, i.e., plasma containing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, obtained from individuals who
have recovered from COVID-19, has a good safety record, data to suggest efficacy in severe disease,
and was recently given emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA for use in COVID-19.3 Studies
in children and adults are ongoing, with best results anticipated in patients who receive products with
high neutralization titers. To date, the most encouraging antiviral agent is remdesivir, with some data
showing it decreases time to recovery in adults.4 Antiviral treatment is likely most effective earlier in the
illness (day 0-7) when there is active viral replication. It has been given emergency use authorization for
the treatment of SARS-Co-V-2 in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with severe disease.
Emerging data suggests that monoclonal antibody therapy to SARS-COV2 may mitigate severe disease
in outpatients early in the disease process, with either casirivimab and imdevimab or bamlanivimab
(under EUA). 5, 6
Coagulopathy and bleeding diathesis: SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes patients to venous and
arterial thrombosis, due to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction and
stasis. 7 Venous thromboembolism incidence risk is associated with disease severity, ≤70% in intensive
care patients.7 Bleeding diatheses also occur in up to 5% of patients with COVID-19 and can be
accompanied by hypofibrinogemia.7 To risk stratify, follow coagulation and hematology labs daily.
Intermediate dose prophylaxis should be considered in ill patients, using anti-FXa to evaluate resistance
and adjust dosage, including those on therapeutic dosing.

7

Careful consideration of changing renal

function, thrombocytopenia, and impact of BMI on dosing of anticoagulation. Consider a very low
threshold for chest computer tomography angiography, venous ultrasound. In ill adults, post-discharge
thromboembolism prophylaxis could be considered for up to 4-5 weeks.
Inflammation/ cytokine storm: Severe COVID-19 may present with life-threatening, uncompensated
shock similar to cytokine release or macrophage activation syndromes with elevated ferritin, c-reactive
protein, and d-dimers. Hallmarks include lymphopenia, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis

factor alpha. Tociluzumab, an IL-6 antagonist, has shown survival benefit in the treatment of COVID198 without affecting viral clearance. This may be especially important for immunocompromised
patients e.g. after cellular transplantation.9 In contrast, the risks of secondary infections have cautioned
against systemic steroids in patients who do not have ARDS. For those refractory to tocilizumab, a
method for in-line cytokine removal, CytoSorb, has received EUA for adults, though limited data exists.
Post-infectious syndromes: Post-infectious syndromes such as a Guillain-Barré and a severe multisystem disease inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) (also called pediatric inflammatory
multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2) are emerging. MIS-C, is characterized
by fever with one of the following: hypotension or shock, severe cardiac illness, severe end-organ
involvement; or two or more of the following: maculopapular rash, bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis,
mucocutaneous inflammatory signs, acute gastrointestinal symptoms; and not explained by another
diagnosis.10 Echocardiogram should be performed at presentation and repeated in 1-2 weeks. Treatment
includes supportive care alongside consideration of immunomodulation, e.g. steroids, intravenous
immunoglobulin, with uncommon use of inhibitors to IL-1 or Il-6, and anticoagulation.10
This perspective is not a guideline, but provides a brief summary of current considerations for the care
of patients with COVID-19, including details of: pulmonary and intensive care management, specific
treatments for severe disease, coagulopathy, dysregulated inflammation, and post-infectious syndromes.
The care of COVID-19 patients is a rapidly evolving field, which will require continued collaborations
across disciplines and age groups to best care for these patients and improve outcomes as is highlighted
by the patient synopsis.

Conflict of Interest statement: All authors have no relevant conflict of interest for this work. Dr. Agwu
has served as an HIV expert on the scientific advisory board of Gilead Sciences and expert advisory
panel and consultant for Merck Pharmaceuticals for HIV therapies. Searches for institutional funding
from Gilead (remdesivir) and Roche (Tociluzumab) revealed only that Emory University received a

COMPASS grant from Gilead for HIV therapies. No known monetary compensation from industry
related to COVID-19 is forthcoming to the hospitals/authors listed on this manuscript.

Author statement: All authors contributed to the generation of the manuscript, editing, and final review.
Dr. Williams initially crafted the outline of the manuscript and the panel of individuals to be included,
which was further broadened by those individuals’ subsequent invitations.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has proven to be
a signiﬁcant challenge both for physicians and patients with chronic
conditions. There is a continuous ﬂow of data for patients with congenital
heart disease, however resources are limited and recommendations rely
mainly on expert opinion [2]. Complex adult congenital heart disease
(ACHD) patients represent a highly heterogenous population with great
anatomical complexity and are considered a high-risk group for complications associated with COVID-19 [1]. Herein, we present ﬁve cases of
complex ACHD diagnosed with COVID-19 (Table 1). Informed consent
has been obtained from each patient presented.
Cases managed in hospital
Case 1
A 35-year old male with a history of Eisenmenger syndrome in the
setting of unrepaired ventricular septal defect (VSD) and atrial septal
defect (ASD) was presented to the emergency department because of
persistent fever and productive cough. He had already been diagnosed
positive with SARS-CoV-2 infection ten days ago. Vitals at admission
revealed oxygen desaturation at 74% with a baseline SO2 at 80%,
without respiratory distress. An ECG was performed and revealed the
known right ventricular hypertrophy patient's pattern with no ischaemic
or arrhythmic alterations. The admission laboratory tests were signiﬁcant
for increased LDH and CRP values, without lymphopenia and increased
haemoglobin 18.9 g/dl. NT-proBNP was 108 pg/ml. A chest CT was
performed and revealed extensive bilateral lesions compatible with
COVID-19 (Fig. 1). The patient required oxygen therapy via a face mask
(he could not tolerate nasal cannula) at 5L/min to achieve oxygen saturation 80–85%. He was started on remdesivir, dexamethasone, ampicillin/sulbactam and azithromycin. His baseline medication included
bosentan and acenocoumarol, which were continued. Throughout hospitalization he was clinically stable, progressively tapered off oxygen
therapy and was discharged after 7 days.
Case 2
A 28-year old male with a history of transposition of the great arteries
and atrial switch operation was presented to the emergency department

due to fever. Rapid antigen SARS-CoV-2 testing was positive and was
later conﬁrmed by RT-PCR testing. Arterial blood gases showed satisfactory partial pressure of oxygen 78 mmHg on air. Laboratory measurements included mildly increased CRP, LDH and d-dimer levels and
reduced lymphocyte count but normal ferritin levels. BNP at admission
was 275 pg/ml (baseline NT-proBNP was 636 pg/ml). A chest CT
revealed small areas of ground glass opacity bilaterally and mainly in the
right lower pulmonary lobe (Figure). An echocardiogram was performed
at the COVID-19 ward and was not altered from baseline, namely a hypertrophied and dilated systemic right ventricle with moderate systolic
dysfunction and severe systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation. The
patient was started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin and low molecular
weight heparin and continued baseline therapy with b-blocker, sacubitril/valsartan, eplerenone and furosemide. He did not require any oxygen
therapy throughout his stay. His hospitalization lasted 8 days and was
discharged in a stable condition.
Cases managed at home
Three patients with complex ACHD were diagnosed with COVID-19
and were managed at home (Table). All patients reported fever, one patient fatigue and another sore throat. None experienced dyspnoea, chest
pain or arrhythmia during the disease. They were instructed to an everyday measurement of oxygen saturation and early admission in case of
deterioration. The median symptomatic duration was 6 days and all
patients completed a 14-day self-isolation uneventfully.
Teleconsultation for all infected patients has been scheduled one
month after the infection in order to evaluate their post-COVID clinical
status.
Risk stratiﬁcation and treatment considerations in complex ACHD
patients with COVID-19 remain vague. However, factors such as the
presence of physiologic state C and D, rather than sole anatomic
complexity, seem to be of paramount importance in relation to the
severity of COVID-19 disease and decreased ventricular function is linked
to a longer duration of symptoms [3]. Patients with cyanotic heart disease, systemic right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension
are prone to arrhythmias and rapid clinical deterioration [4]. Ideally,
these patients should be admitted in expertized ACHD centres [5]. In our
case, a multidisciplinary approach, involving continuous communication

Fig. 1. A: Case 1. Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) ﬁndings consist of pure ground glass opacities (GGOs) and patchy consolidation surrounded by
wide range of GGOs distributed in both lower lung ﬁelds. В: Case 2. Chest HRCT, less extended, yet similar ﬁndings are localized mainly on the right and are
characterized by lower density of the lesions. In comparison with case 1, this CT image is in accordance with milder clinical course of the disease.

Funding

of attending internists and the ACHD expert, was opted for hospitalized
patients. Suitably, treatment in Eisenmenger syndrome was titrated according to the baseline oxygen saturation, consistent with the elevated
haemoblogin levels. Also, echocardiography, as illustrated in the second
case, is not a routine as we know it and is only performed to assess
deterioration in cardiac function and/or presence of pericardial effusion,
and no extensive measurements are performed in order to prevent prolonged patient-echocardiographist contact. Lastly, there is no speciﬁc
treatment targeting SARS-CoV-2 at the moment, therefore, hospitalized
patients needing oxygen supplementation were treated mainly with
remdesivir and dexamethasone [6].
There is limited amount of data as to which factors related to ACHD
are prognostic for COVID-19 increased severity and is hard to predict
clinical outcomes [7]. However, amidst the pandemic, the need for
intensive follow-up of ACHD patients, no matter if their clinical condition is deemed stable, persists [8]. Vaccines offer hope, however the
limited availability of data hinders speciﬁc recommendations. In other
respects, ACHD patients should maintain a healthy, active lifestyle,
maintain social distancing and utilize technology to preserve continuity
of care [9,10].

Dear Sir,

lP

During the early stages of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, some reports hinted at a
“protective” effect of BCG vaccination regarding COVID-19, mainly in terms of avoided

mortality (1,2). As a result, BCG vaccination emerged as being possibly instrumental in
“flattening” the curves of the pandemic.
However, in a previous systematic review, we suggested that initial reports may have been
“distorted” by the diachronous nature of the pandemic, of which the early stages strongly
depended on the spreading of single outbreaks, which in turn were the eventual consequence
of separate, even serendipitous events (3). While Europe is faced with a sustained resurgence
of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is reasonable to surmise that initial differences may have been
leveled out, allowing more consistent comparison between various countries, particularly
when dealing with ecological factors such as BCG vaccination rates.

Therefore, with the aim of assessing the actual effect of BCG vaccination rates on SARS-CoV2 incidence rates and mortality, we retrieved official data on 47 European Countries from the
ECDC “COVID-19 situation update for the EU/EEA” (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019ncov-eueea) in the 01/03/2020–14/12/2020 timeframe. Available data included daily
notification rates on new COVID-19 cases and deaths. Respective 7-day moving average for
notification of incident cases and 14-day moving average for death cases were calculated

accordingly. As BCG vaccination policies across European countries have been and remain
quite heterogeneous (4), we utilized 12th month vaccination coverage 1980-2019 from

models that were assumed as explanatory variables: BCG rate, population density, share of
the general population aged 60 years or older, and two synthetic indices represented by the
Gini coefficient and the Human Development Index (HDI) (5). The aforementioned factors
were retrieved from the Eurostat database (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/). Gini Coefficient
is a measure of statistical dispersion designed to represent income inequality or wealth
inequality within a nation. HDI is a composite statistical index of life expectancy, education,
and per capita income. A summary of raw data is reported in Appendix 1.

Notification rates were not correlated with BCG rates or economic and demographic indices,
nor, as shown in Table 1, was BCG rate an effective predictor for either incident cases (Beta

0.074; 95%CI -1.364 to 1512, p = 0.918) or death cases (Beta -0.016; 95%CI -0.046 to 0.013 p
= 0.271).

Our estimates are affected by significant limits. First, not only are European policies on BCG
heterogenous, but also, the reporting of corresponding vaccination rates is often inconsistent
(4). As a result, we were forced to approximate, referring to a proxy rather than to actual

vaccination rates. Second, notification rates on COVID-19 are characterized by significant
heterogeneities, with resultingly uncertain estimates (6). Third, different European countries
applied mitigation measures that were heterogenous in terms of timing, scope and means

To conclude, our analyses suggest that the effects of BCG on the ongoing dynamics of the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are very difficult, if not impossible to ascertain,. Even though the role
of BCG-elicited “trained immunity” (i.e. enhanced reactivity of the innate immune system by
means of increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines) in COVID-19 has not been
clearly ruled out, there is no evidence that BCG may protect people against SARS-CoV-2
infection (1–3), and there is no evidence justifying recommendation of BCG vaccination as a
means of preventing COVID-19.

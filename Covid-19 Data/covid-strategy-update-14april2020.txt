FOREWORD
Overcoming COVID‑19
It has now been more than 100 days since WHO was
notified of the first cases of what we now call COVID­‑19,
and much has changed since we launched the first Strategic
Preparedness and Response Plan two months ago.
As of 13 April, more than 1.7 million people have been infected, and almost
85 000 people have lost their lives. WHO grieves with all families who have lost
a loved one, and salutes health workers all over the world who have put themselves
in harm’s way every day to save lives.
The global spread of the virus has overwhelmed health systems, and caused
widespread social and economic disruption.
By putting societies and economies on hold, we have curtailed the ability of the
virus to spread through our communities. These defensive measures have helped
to limit some of the short-term impacts of the virus, and bought us time to translate
what we have learned about the virus into solutions so that we can get back
to a more normal way of living: a new normal.
We have learned so much about this virus, and we’re still learning. This strategy
update is based on the evidence the world has accumulated in the past three
months about how COVID‑19 spreads, the severity of disease it causes, how
to treat it, and how to stop it.
One of the main things we’ve learned is that the faster all cases are found, tested
and isolated, the harder we make it for this virus to spread. This principle will save
lives and mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.
This document guides the public health response to COVID‑19 at national
and subnational levels, including practical guidance for strategic action, tailored
to the local context.
This pandemic is much more than a health crisis. It requires a whole-of-government
and whole-of-society response. The resolve and sacrifice of frontline health
workers must be matched by every individual and every political leader to put
in place the measures to end the pandemic.
We’re all in this together, and we will only succeed together. There is no time
to waste. WHO’s singular focus is on working to serve all people to save lives
and stop the pandemic.

COVID-19 STRATEGY UPDATE

ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic is exacting a huge toll on individuals,
families, communities, and societies across the world. Daily lives have been profoundly
changed, economies have fallen into recession, and many of the traditional social,
economic, and public health safety nets that many people rely on in times of hardship
have been put under unprecedented strain.
In just a short time, a localised outbreak of COVID-19 evolved
into a global pandemic with three defining characteristics:

•
•
•

Speed and scale: the disease has spread quickly
to all corners of the world, and its capacity for explosive
spread has overwhelmed even the most resilient health
systems (figure 1).
Severity: overall 20% of cases are severe or critical,
with a crude clinical case fatality rate currently of over
3%, increasing in older age groups and in those with
certain underlying conditions.
Societal and economic disruption: shocks to health
and social care systems and measures taken to control
transmission have had broad and deep socio-economic
consequences.

This document is intended to help guide the public health
response to COVID-19 at national and subnational levels,
and to update the global strategy to respond to the COVID-19
pandemic. This document complements, and provides links
to, the technical guidance published by WHO on preparing
for and responding to COVID-19 since the beginning of the
response. It translates knowledge accumulated since the
publication of the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan
(SPRP)1 on 3 February 2020, into additional practical guidance
for whole-of-government and whole-of-society strategic
action that can be adapted according to specific national
and subnational situations and capacities.
This strategy update provides guidance for countries preparing
for a phased transition from widespread transmission to a
steady state of low-level or no transmission. This update also
highlights the coordinated support that is required from the
international community to meet the challenge of COVID‑19:
it complements plans (including the Global Humanitarian
Response Plan)2 that specifically address the issues
of COVID‑19 response in humanitarian and fragile settings,
and plans currently under development that will address
the broader social and economic impacts of COVID‑19.

CURRENT SITUATION
AND KEY INSIGHTS
COVID‑19 is a new disease, distinct from other diseases caused by coronaviruses, such
as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS). The virus spreads rapidly, and outbreaks can grow at an exponential rate. At
present, there are no therapeutics or vaccines proven to treat or prevent COVID‑19, although
national governments, WHO and partners are working urgently to coordinate the rapid
development of medical countermeasures.3 According to data from countries affected early
in the pandemic, about 40% of cases will experience mild disease, 40% will experience
moderate disease including pneumonia, 15% of cases will experience severe disease,
and 5% of cases will have critical disease.
The crude mortality rate varies substantially by country
depending on the populations affected, the point a country
is at in the trajectory of its outbreak, and the availability
and application of testing (countries that only test
hospitalized cases will have a higher reported crude mortality
rate than countries with more widespread testing). The crude
clinical case fatality is currently over 3%, increasing with
age and rising to approximately 15% or higher in patients
over 80 years of age. Morbidity associated with COVID‑19
is also very high. Underlying health conditions that affect
the cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune systems confer
an increased risk of severe illness and death.
Countries are at different stages of national and subnational
outbreaks. Where there has been early action and
implementation of comprehensive public health measures –
such as rapid case identification, rapid testing and isolation
of cases, comprehensive contact tracing and quarantine
of contacts – countries and subnational regions have
suppressed the spread of COVID‑19 below the threshold
at which health systems become unable to prevent excess
mortality. Countries that have been able to reduce transmission
and bring outbreaks under control have maintained the
ability to deliver quality clinical care, and minimize secondary
mortality due to other causes through the continued safe
delivery of essential health services.

For countries that have introduced widespread physical
distancing measures and population-level movement
restrictions, there is an urgent need to plan for a phased
transition away from such restrictions in a manner that
will enable the sustainable suppression of transmission
at a low-level whilst enabling the resumption of some
parts of economic and social life, prioritized by carefully
balancing socio-economic benefit and epidemiological
risk. Without careful planning, and in the absence of scaled
up public health and clinical care capacities, the premature
lifting of physical distancing measures is likely to lead
to an uncontrolled resurgence in COVID‑19 transmission
and an amplified second wave of cases.
For countries that currently have few reported cases,
there is no time to lose in learning and applying the lessons
of others to specific national contexts and capacities.

In many countries where community transmission has
led to outbreaks with near exponential growth, countries
have introduced widespread population-level physical
distancing measures and movement restrictions in order
to slow spread and set in place other control measures.
Physical distancing measures and movement restrictions,
often referred to as “shut downs” and “lock downs,” can
slow COVID‑19 transmission by limiting contact between
people. However, these measures can have a profound
negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies
by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such
measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups,
including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced
people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded
and under resourced settings, and depend on daily
labour for subsistence.

COVID-19 STRATEGY UPDATE

A renewed focus on public health
Perhaps the most important insight from the global
COVID‑19 response to date has been that to successfully
slow transmission and protect health systems, it is essential
to accurately diagnose and effectively isolate and care for all
cases of COVID‑19 including cases with mild or moderate
disease (in health setting or home setting, depending on
the context and degree of illness).

A renewed focus on large-scale public health capacities must
be implemented with urgency. The world stands at a pivotal
juncture in the course of this pandemic. Collaborative
research and knowledge sharing have helped to answer
crucial questions about the benefits and costs of different
response strategies in different contexts, the transmissibility
of the virus, the clinical spectrum of the disease, and its
capacity to rapidly overwhelm even the most resilient health
systems. We know now what we are up against, and we
are learning how to beat it. COVID‑19 threatens human life,
threatens livelihoods, and threatens the way of life of every
individual in every society.

As COVID‑19 transmission has advanced globally,
the primary focus of most countries has been the rapid
identification, testing and treatment of patients with serious
and severe COVID‑19, and the sheltering of individuals at
the highest risk of poor outcomes. Fewer have put in place
measures for those with mild disease, or contacts of cases.

Speed, scale, and equity must be our guiding principles.
Speed, because the explosive nature of the virus means
every day lost in implementing effective response capacities
and behaviors costs lives; scale, because everyone in society
has a part to play in building the capacities required to
control this pandemic; and equity, because everyone is at risk
until the virus is controlled everywhere in the world: collective
resources must be directed to where there is greatest risk.
COVID‑19 is a truly global crisis: the only way to overcome
it is together, in global solidarity.

Countries must do everything they can to stop cases from
becoming clusters and clusters from becoming explosive
outbreaks. They must put in place the capacities for testing
and diagnosis, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine;
they must engage everyone in the response.

GLOBAL STRATEGY
TO RESPOND TO COVID‑19
The overarching goal is for all countries to control the pandemic by slowing
down the transmission and reducing mortality associated with COVID‑19.
The global strategic objectives are as follows:

•

•
•

•
•

Mobilize all sectors and communities to ensure that
every sector of government and society takes ownership
of and participates in the response and in preventing
cases through hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette
and individual‑level physical distancing.
Control sporadic cases and clusters and prevent
community transmission by rapidly finding and isolating
all cases, providing them with appropriate care, and
tracing, quarantining, and supporting all contacts.
Suppress community transmission through
context‑appropriate infection prevention and control
measures, population level physical distancing
measures, and appropriate and proportionate restrictions
on non‑essential domestic and international travel.
Reduce mortality by providing appropriate clinical care
for those affected by COVID‑19, ensuring the continuity
of essential health and social services, and protecting
frontline workers and vulnerable populations.
Develop safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics
that can be delivered at scale and that are accessible
based on need.

COVID-19 STRATEGY UPDATE

Every country should be implementing a comprehensive
set of measures, calibrated to their capacity and context,
to slow down transmission and reduce mortality associated
with COVID‑19, ultimately with the aim of reaching and/or
maintaining a steady state of low-level or no transmission.
Appropriate strategies at the national level and subnational
level must balance measures that address the direct mortality
attributable to COVID‑19, the indirect mortality caused by
the overwhelming of health systems and the interruption of
other essential health and social services, and the acute and
long-term detrimental effects on health and wellbeing of the
socioeconomic consequences of certain response measures.
Maintaining a steady state of low-level or no transmission
is important because, as the pandemic has spread, its public
health and socioeconomic impacts have been profound,
and have disproportionately affected the vulnerable. Many
populations have already experienced a lack of access to
routine, essential health services. Migrants, refugees, displaced
populations, and residents of high-density and informal
settlements, are at a particularly high risk from the interruption
of already limited health and social services. The closure of
schools increases the risk of some students being neglected,
abused or exploited, and risks the interruption of basic
services such as school meals. Every action taken now to slow
the transmission of COVID‑19 is an action that brings forward
the day that these services can return.
The risk of re-introduction and resurgence of the disease
will continue and will need to be sustainably controlled
through the rigorous application of public health interventions
as the virus circulates between and within countries.
Ultimately, the development and delivery of a safe and
effective vaccine or vaccines and therapeutics may enable
a transition away from some of the measures necessary
to maintain this state of low-level or no transmission.

5

To prevail against COVID‑19, we need an approach that
unites in common cause every individual and community,
every business and non-profit, every department of every
government, every non-governmental organization, every
international organization, and every regional and global
governance body, to harness their collective capacity
into collective action. Everyone has a crucial role to
play in stopping COVID‑19:

•

•

•

Individuals must protect themselves and others
by adopting behaviours such as washing hands, avoiding
touching their face, practicing good respiratory etiquette,
individual level distancing, isolating in a community
facility or at home if they are sick, identifying themselves
as a contact of a confirmed case when appropriate,
and cooperating with physical distancing measures
and movement restrictions when called on to do so.
Communities must be empowered to ensure that services
and aid are planned and adapted based on their feedback
and local contexts. Critical functions, such as community
education, protecting vulnerable groups, supporting health
workers, case finding, contact tracing, and cooperation
with physical distancing measures can only happen with
the support of every part of affected communities.

•

Governments must lead and coordinate the response
across party lines to enable and empower all individuals
and communities to own the response through
communication, education, engagement, capacity building
and support. Governments must also re-purpose and
engage all available public, community and private sector
capacity to rapidly scale up the public health system
to find and test, isolate, and care for confirmed cases
(whether at home or in a medical facility), and identify,
trace, quarantine and support contacts. At the same time,
governments must give the health system the support
it needs to treat patients with COVID‑19 effectively
and maintain other essential health and social services
for all. Governments may have to implement blanket
physical distancing measures and movement restrictions
proportionate to the health risks faced by the community,
if they need more time to put in place the above measures.
Private companies must ensure the continuity
of essential services such as the food chain, public
utilities, and the manufacture of medical supplies.
Private companies can provide expertise and innovation
to scale and sustain the response, most notably through
the production and equitable distribution of laboratory
diagnostics, personal protective equipment, ventilators,
medical oxygen and other essential medical equipment
at fair prices, and the research and development
of diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines.

NATIONAL STRATEGIES
TO RESPOND TO COVID‑19
Each country must continue to implement National Action Plans based on a whole-ofsociety approach and a realistic appraisal of what is feasible to achieve first in terms
of slowing down transmission and reducing mortality, and subsequently in terms of
sustaining low level transmission while society and economic activity resumes. Plans
must be flexible enough to react to rapidly changing epidemiological situations in different
parts of the country, and take into account the local contexts and capacities to respond.4
The core pillars of an effective national response were set out in detail in the SPRP.
Every national strategy has a crucial part to play in
meeting the global objectives, and must, at a minimum,
set out the basis for a) coordination of the national and
subnational response; b) engagement and mobilization
of affected and at‑risk communities; c) implementation
of context‑appropriate public health measures to slow
transmission and control sporadic cases; d) preparation
of the health system to reduce COVID‑19-associated
mortality, maintain essential health services, and protect
health workers, and e) contingency planning to ensure
continuity of essential public functions and services.

For example, many countries that have implemented
restrictions on movement outside of households have
reported sharp increases in gender-based violence, primarily
impacting women. Additionally, women are often most likely
to be in insecure work and least likely to be covered by
income‑protection schemes, which are primarily designed
for workers in formal employment.

Coordination and planning

Slowing the transmission of COVID‑19 and protecting
communities will require the participation of every member
of at-risk and affected communities6 to prevent infection
and transmission. This requires everyone adopting individual
protection measures such as washing hands, avoiding
touching their face, practicing good respiratory etiquette,
individual level distancing and cooperating with physical
distancing measures and movement restrictions when
called on to do so.

Successful implementation of adaptive COVID‑19
preparedness and response strategies will depend on
all of society being engaged in the plan, and strong national
and subnational coordination.5 To provide coordinated
management of COVID‑19 preparedness and response,
national public health emergency management mechanisms,
including a multidisciplinary national coordination cell
or incident management structure, should be activated,
with the engagement of relevant ministries such as health,
foreign affairs, finance, education, transport, travel and
tourism, public works, water and sanitation, environment,
social protection and agriculture. In certain contexts,
this may be through the support of National Disaster
Management or other crisis management authorities.
If they have not done so already, national authorities
should, as a matter of urgency, develop operational plans
to address COVID‑19. Plans should include capacity
assessments and risk analyses to identify high-risk and
vulnerable populations. Plans should include civil society
and national NGOs to extend the reach of public health
and socioeconomic interventions. National plans should
also be developed for the prevention and mitigation of
the social impacts of the crisis, including areas of the
response that disproportionately affect women and girls.

Engage and mobilize communities
to limit exposure

It is therefore essential that international, national, and
local authorities engage through participatory two-way
communication efforts proactively, regularly, transparently
and unambiguously with all affected and at-risk populations.
Understanding knowledge, behaviours, perceptions, and
identifying the right channels and community-based networks
and influencers to promote scientific and public health
messages will be a key determinant of the effectiveness of
the response. Building the capacity of national, regional, and
local stakeholders is essential to establish authority and trust.
The role women play in communities needs to be harnessed
in community mobilization efforts.
Participatory community engagement interventions should
include accurate information on risks, what is still unknown,
what is being done to find answers, what actions are being
taken by health authorities, and what actions people can
take to protect themselves.

COVID-19 STRATEGY UPDATE

Ensuring that global recommendations and communications
are tested and adapted to local contexts is an essential
part of helping countries to empower communities to own
the response and control the COVID‑19 pandemic. Informed
and empowered populations can protect themselves
by taking measures at the individual and community
level that will reduce the risk of transmission.
By contrast, misleading, ambiguous, and false information
can have serious negative public health consequences,
including by undermining adherence to physical distancing
measures and movement restrictions, promoting the hoarding
and inappropriate use of essential supplies and equipment,
and encouraging the inappropriate use of potentially
dangerous or fatal curative and prophylactic measures
without any evidence of benefit.
In all the above, countries must ensure that communities,
including the most hard-to-reach and vulnerable groups,
have a voice and are part of the response.

Find, test, isolate and care for
cases and quarantine contacts
to control transmission
Stopping the spread of COVID‑19 requires finding and testing
all suspected cases so that confirmed cases are promptly
and effectively isolated and receive appropriate care, and the
close contacts of all confirmed cases are rapidly identified
so that they can be quarantined and medically monitored for
the 14‑day incubation period7 of the virus.
To achieve this, countries and communities must fundamentally
increase their capacity to identify suspected cases of COVID‑19
in the general population quickly based on the onset of signs
or symptoms. This will require a shift from reliance on existing
surveillance networks to system of rapid, population-level active
surveillance. In addition to active case finding in communities,
health facilities, and at points of entry, it will be necessary to
enable the general population to practice self-surveillance, in
which individuals are asked to self-report as a suspected case
as soon as they have symptoms or signs and/or if they are a
contact of a confirmed case. To achieve this shift, countries will
need to rapidly scale up their workforce to find cases, including
by looking outside the traditional public health system to train
non-public-health workers, and by using innovative technology
such as online applications to enable individuals to self-report.

Once suspected cases are identified they should be tested
immediately to confirm or rule out infection with COVID‑19.
In contexts where testing is not possible, confirmation
of COVID‑19 may instead be based on reported symptoms
or signs.
Confirmed cases – whether confirmed through testing or on
the basis of symptoms or signs – should be safely, effectively,
and rapidly isolated to prevent onward transmission in the
community. Ideally, confirmed cases should be isolated
in dedicated facilities to minimize the potential for onward
transmission and maximize the provision of any support
necessary. If this is not possible, and cases are instead required
to self-isolate in households, there should be appropriate
follow‑up and support to ensure that individuals are able
to self isolate effectively with no social contact.
It is also essential to identify and trace the close contacts
of every confirmed or probable case, and quarantine
and monitor them for 14 days. This ensures that even
pre‑symptomatic cases (and potentially asymptomatic cases)
that arise as a result of contact with a confirmed case do not
mix with the general population. Quarantine can be a stressful
experience and a significant imposition and disruption to the life
of the quarantined individual and their family. Every effort must
be made to support individuals required to undergo quarantine,
including through the provision of basic necessities, income
support, psychosocial support, and health care as needed.

Provide clinical care and
maintain essential health services
to reduce mortality
One of the defining features of COVID‑19 is the huge stress
placed on health systems and health workers by the large
proportion of COVID‑19 patients who can require quality
clinical care.8 Many patients need help to breathe, with
outbreaks placing acute burdens on staffing levels, availability
of equipment, and crucial supplies such as medical oxygen,
ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE). Frontline
health workers have had to put themselves in harm’s way
to save lives, and some have lost their own lives as a result.
In many countries, women account for up to 70% of the
health workforce, and have therefore been disproportionality
affected. Even very robust health systems can be rapidly
overwhelmed and compromised by an explosive COVID­‑19
outbreak. Contingency planning should include extreme
scenarios, such as the need to rapidly and completely
reconfigure and largely repurpose the entire health sector.

In addition to the direct mortality caused by COVID‑19,
response at the national and subnational level must also
address the risks of indirect mortality posed by the possible
interruption of essential health and social services. The
acute burden that COVID‑19 places on health systems,
combined with the disruptive effects of shielding strategies,
physical distancing and movement restrictions, must be
mitigated in order to minimize the negative health impacts
of COVID‑19 on individuals who depend on essential,
non‑COVID‑19-related services.
Maintaining population trust in the capacity of the health
system to safely meet essential needs and to control
infection risk in health facilities is key to ensuring appropriate
care‑seeking behavior and adherence to public health advice.
Continuation of primary health care services is essential.
Where possible, the use of technological solutions such
as telemedicine to monitor patients and remote consultations
should be considered, to minimize risk to patients.
Countries will need to make difficult decisions to balance
the demands of responding directly to COVID‑19, while
simultaneously engaging in strategic planning and coordinated
action to maintain essential health service delivery, mitigating
the risk of system collapse. Many routine and elective services
might have to be postponed or suspended. In addition, when
routine practice comes under pressure due to competing
demands, simplified purpose-designed governance
mechanisms and protocols can mitigate outright system
failure. Establishing effective patient flow (through screening,
triage, and targeted referral of COVID‑19 and non-COVID‑19
cases) is essential at all levels.

Adapt strategies based on risk,
capacity, and vulnerability
The ability of countries to engage and mobilize communities;
find, test, and isolate cases; provide effective clinical care;
and maintain essential health services will differ according
to their capacity and context as well as the intensity and
prevalence of COVID‑19 transmission. The combination
of public health measures that should be implemented at
any one time will depend to a large extent on whether there
is community transmission, clusters of cases, sporadic cases,
or no cases and the capacity of the public health system.
Every country must put in place comprehensive public
health measures to maintain a sustainable steady state
of low-level or no transmission and have the surge capacity
to rapidly control sporadic cases and clusters of cases
to prevent community transmission from occurring.
If community transmission occurs, exceptional measures
will need to be taken to suppress transmission as quickly
as possible and transition back to a steady state of low‑level
or no transmission. This approach needs to be applied
at the lowest administrative level possible in each country
to ensure a tailored and appropriate response depending
on the situation and capacities to respond.

COVID-19 STRATEGY UPDATE

Suppressing community transmission
Even with the proactive implementation of comprehensive
public health measures, transmission of COVID‑19 can rapidly
become established in countries and subnational regions,
with explosive outbreaks that grow at an exponential rate.
In countries and/or subnational regions in which community
transmission has become established, or that are at risk
of entering this phase of an epidemic, authorities must
immediately adopt and adapt population-level distancing
measures and movement restrictions in addition to other
public health and health system measures to reduce
exposure and suppress transmission, including the following:

•
•
•
•

Personal measures that reduce the risk of person-toperson transmission, such as hand washing, physical
distancing, and respiratory etiquette;
Community-level measures to reduce contact between
individuals, such as the suspension of mass gatherings,
the closure of non-essential places of work and educational
establishments, and reduced public transport;
Measures to reduce the risk of importation or reintroduction
of the virus from high-transmission areas, such as limits
on national and international travel, enhanced screening
and quarantine;
Measures to ensure the protection of health workers and
vulnerable groups, such as through the provision of correct
personal protective equipment.

Targeted and time-limited implementation of these measures
will potentially reduce mortality by flattening the trajectory
of the epidemic and relieving some pressure on clinical
care services. However, these measures are blunt tools
with considerable social and economic costs, and should
be implemented with the understanding, consent, and
participation of communities, and based on the principle
of doing no harm. The risks of implementing these measures
must be effectively communicated to the affected populations
and communities engaged to own and participate in them.
Support systems must be in place to ensure communities
are able to comply with these measures. Individuals,
especially the most vulnerable, must also be supported
(and be provided with refuge or safe spaces where necessary)
through coordinated economic and social measures that
provide incentives to participate, and which mitigate negative
social and economic consequences. Food security, mental
health, and gender safeguarding issues, including the need
to protect women from an increased risk of domestic abuse,
are high‑priority areas for attention.
The precise nature and feasibility of implementing
these measures will be heavily dependent on the context
of affected communities. In low-income and crisis settings,
physical distancing and movement restrictions are structurally
more difficult to implement, and should only be implemented
where justified by an analysis of the trade-offs between
public health measures against COVID‑19 and the necessity
for people to meet their basic food and protection needs.

9

During periods of sustained community transmission,
diagnostic capacity may be insufficient, and it may be
necessary to prioritize testing of vulnerable populations
who are at risk of developing severe disease; symptomatic
health workers and essential staff; and the first symptomatic
individuals in a closed setting (e.g. schools, long term
living facilities, prisons, hospitals) to quickly identify
outbreaks and implement effective isolation of all
confirmed and suspected cases.
Innovative solutions to increase clinical care capacity
will be required, such as substantially reconfiguring
existing health facilities and repurposing existing public
and private facilities to provide safe areas for emergency
case management, quarantine and isolation – this should
be feasible even in remote and low resource areas. Rapid
expansion of clinical capacity for life-saving measures should
be focused on care for the majority of patients through
simple treatments such as providing oxygen. Other essential
health and social services and systems must be maintained
wherever possible with a focus on primary health care.
The necessary duration of physical distancing measures
and movement restrictions will be difficult to calculate
accurately before their implementation: it is prudent to plan
for the application of such measures for two to three months
based on the experiences of the countries first affected
by COVID‑19.

Transitioning to and maintaining a steady
state of low-level or no transmission
For many countries and subnational authorities and
communities, managing a controlled and deliberate transition
from a scenario of community transmission to a sustainable,
steady state of low-level or no transmission is, at present,
the best-case outcome in the short and medium term in the
absence of a safe and effective vaccine. For countries yet
to report community transmission, preventing the escalation
of transmission and maintaining a steady state of low-level
or no transmission may be feasible.
Achieving either of these aims will hinge on the ability
of national and/or subnational authorities to ensure
that six key criteria are satisfied:
1 COVID‑19 transmission is controlled to a level of
sporadic cases and clusters of cases, all from known
contacts or importations and the incidence of new cases
should be maintained at a level that the health system can
manage with substantial clinical care capacity in reserve.

2 Sufficient health system and public health capacities
are in place to enable the major shift from detecting
and treating mainly serious cases to detecting and
isolating all cases, irrespective of severity and origin:
• Detection: suspect cases should be detected quickly
after symptom onset through active case finding,
self‑reporting, entry screening, and other approaches;
• Testing: all suspected cases should have test results
within 24 hours of identification and sampling, and
there would be sufficient capacity to verify the virus-free
status of patients who have recovered;9
Isolation:
all confirmed cases could be effectively
•
isolated (in hospitals and/or designated housing for mild
and moderate cases, or at home with sufficient support
if designated housing is not available) immediately and
until they are no longer infectious;10
• Quarantine: all close contacts could be traced,
quarantined and monitored for 14 days, whether
in specialized accommodation or self-quarantine.
Monitoring and support can be done through
a combination of visits by community volunteers,
phone calls, or messaging.11
3 Outbreak risks in high-vulnerability settings
are minimized, which requires all major drivers
and/or amplifiers of COVID-19 transmission to have
been identified, with appropriate measures in place
to minimize the risk of new outbreaks and of nosocomial
transmission (e.g. appropriate infection prevention
and control, including triage, and provision of personal
protective equipment in health care facilities and
residential care settings).12
4 Workplace preventive measures are established
to reduce risk, including the appropriate directives
and capacities to promote and enable standard COVID‑19
prevention measures in terms of physical distancing, hand
washing, respiratory etiquette and, potentially, temperature
monitoring.13
5 Risk of imported cases managed through an
analysis of the likely origin and routes of importations,
and measures would be in place to rapidly detect and
manage suspected cases among travelers (including
the capacity to quarantine individuals arriving from
areas with community transmission).
6 Communities are fully engaged and understand that the
transition entails a major shift, from detecting and treating
only serious cases to detecting and isolating all cases, that
behavioural prevention measures must be maintained, and
that all individuals have key roles in enabling and in some
cases implementing new control measures.

COVID-19 STRATEGY UPDATE

Decisions about when and where to transition must
be evidence based, data driven and implemented
incrementally. It is essential to have real-time, accurate data
on the testing of suspected cases, the nature and isolation
status of all confirmed cases, the number of contacts per
case and completeness of tracing, and the dynamic capacity
of health systems to deal with COVID-19 cases.
To reduce the risk of new outbreaks, measures should be
lifted in a phased, step-wise manner based on an assessment
of the epidemiological risks and socioeconomic benefits
of lifting restrictions on different workplaces, educational
institutions, and social activities (such as concerts, religious
events, sporting events). Risk assessments may eventually
benefit from serological testing, when reliable assays are
available, to inform understanding of population susceptibility
to COVID‑19.
Ideally there would be a minimum of 2 weeks (corresponding
to the incubation period of COVID‑19) between each phase
of the transition, to allow sufficient time to understand the
risk of new outbreaks and to respond appropriately.

Low-capacity and humanitarian settings
Many low-capacity countries with comparatively weak health
systems and limited capacity to offset the economic and
social costs of population-level physical distancing, including
some countries with health system fragility and extremely
vulnerable populations, are now reporting sporadic cases,
clusters of cases, and community transmission.14 The window
for containment at the subnational and national level may
be closing in many of these countries.

The trajectory of national outbreaks in these settings
will depend not only on how effectively the health system
capacity can be increased and public health measures
implemented, but also on the complex interplay of
demographics, the prevalence of underlying conditions
associated with poor COVID‑19 outcomes, the prevalence
of infections that could complicate the diagnosis of COVID‑19
(such as malaria, bacterial pneumonias, and tuberculosis),
and the relative importance of social, religious, and cultural
gatherings that have been shown to be important drivers of
COVID‑19 transmission in other contexts.
Within the broader categories of low-capacity settings,
it is also essential to consider the need for measures tailored
specifically to humanitarian settings and high-risk groups.
People affected by humanitarian crises, particularly those
displaced and/or living in camps and camp-like settings,
are often faced with specific challenges and vulnerabilities
that must be taken into consideration when planning for
COVID-19 readiness and response operations. Under the
umbrella of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, WHO has
worked with the IFRC, IOM, and UNHCR to produce interim
guidance15 to scale up readiness and response capacities for
people in humanitarian settings, which may include internally
displaced persons (IDPs), host communities, asylum seekers,
refugees and returnees, and migrants.
People living in collective sites are vulnerable to COVID-19
in part because of the health risks associated with movement
or displacement, overcrowding, increased climatic exposure
due to sub-standard shelter, and poor nutritional and
health status among affected populations. Although some
adaptations of site plans may not be feasible, maximizing
site planning for better distancing among residents and
crowd management, adherence to infection prevention and
control standards, strong risk communication and community
engagement and a good surveillance system to detect initial
cases early can greatly reduce the propensity for COVID-19
to spread within such settings. Appropriate case
management can reduce mortality among those infected with
the virus. The Interim Guidance outlines the necessary steps
to ensure all of these capacities are in place.
As national governments act rapidly to protect their most
vulnerable populations, it is essential that the international
community come together in solidarity to protect the
most vulnerable global populations. To address the needs
of countries where urgent humanitarian activities must
be supported to continue in addition to urgent new health
and non-health requirements due to COVID-19, WHO is part
of the IASC COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan
(GHRP; issued on 25 March 2020) coordinated by the UN
Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
The GHRP sets out the most urgent health and humanitarian
actions required to prepare and respond to COVID-19
in these contexts.

INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY’S
RESPONSE TO COVID‑19
The scale of the COVID‑19 crisis requires a significant shift in the international system
to support countries to plan, finance and implement their response. Countries need
authoritative real-time information on the evolving epidemiology and risks; timely access
to essential supplies, medicines and equipment; the latest technical guidance and best
practices; rapidly accessible and deployable technical expertise, access to an emergency
health workforce and medical teams; and equitable access to newly developed vaccines,
therapeutics, diagnostics and other innovations, as well as complementary socio-economic
measures, including material and protection assistance.
Particular attention and support will be required in countries with low-capacity and
humanitarian settings ill-equipped to cope with COVID‑19 due to weak health systems
and workforces that are heavily reliant on the support of donors, UN and NGO partners.
Coordination and monitoring of country preparedness and response
This document builds on the Strategic Preparedness
and Response Plan (SPRP), which was published on
3 February 2020 and outlined the public health measures
that the international community stands ready to provide
to support all countries to prepare for and respond
to COVID-19. Overall UN coordination is provided through
the UN Crisis Management Team, which was established
on 4 February 2020. This is the highest possible level of
crisis alert in the UN system, and this is the first time this
mechanism has been activated for a public health crisis.
On 12 February 2020, the Operational Planning Guidelines
to support the development National Action Plans were
issued and the COVID-19 Partners Platform was launched
to enable national authorities, UN Country Team and partners
to plan resource needs, allocate resources and identify
funding gaps, and monitor progress against the National
Action Plans at the national and subnational level.
On 25 March 2020, OCHA issued the COVID‑19 Global
Humanitarian Response Plan and activated the IASC
scale-up protocol to mobilize the whole humanitarian
system to support its implementation. Simultaneously,
the UN Development Coordination Office (UNDCO)
has led the development of a UN framework for the
immediate socio-economic response to COVID‑19, which
outlines an integrated support package offered by the
UN Development System to protect the needs and rights
of people living under the duress of the pandemic, with
a focus on the most vulnerable countries, groups, and
people who risk being left behind.
WHO coordinates actively with Member States. They
have been actively engaged in the response and the
WHO Director-General has provided the highest possible
level of representation, advice, and support to all requests
coming from various Member State groupings such as

the African Union, ASEAN, the EU, the G7, the G20, the G12
donors, as well as other regional multilateral organizations
to support and finance the response. WHO provides Member
States the best available advice based on all available
evidence and science as it becomes available.
The World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund
and other multi-lateral development banks and financial
institution’s including GAVI, the Global Fund and UNITAID,
have provided emergency support for developing countries
to fast-track financial and operational facilities for COVID-19
response. Collaborative arrangements established under
Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for
All are being utilized for the COVID-19 response.
Organizations representing aviation, maritime, trade,
and tourism sectors have worked with WHO to develop
joint guidance, joint statements of support, to monitor
the measures taken by governments and private entities
that impact international travel and trade, and to assess
and mitigate the health and economic impact of such
measures, in line with the provisions of the International
Health Regulations (2005). WHO has also developed
risk‑based approaches and guidance for the organization
of mass gathering events,16 and is continuing to work
with key partners from many sectors, including sports and
entertainment sectors, as well as faith-based organizations.
The unique scale of the COVID‑19 crisis requires
the international community to reach out beyond its own
capacity. The private sector has been actively engaged
in the response, with high-level regular participation into
the weekly consultations on the pandemic organized
by industry bodies such as the World Economic Forum
and the International Chamber of Commerce.

Epidemiological analysis
and risk assessment

Risk communication and
community engagement

Ongoing, comprehensive and verified global surveillance
data about COVID‑19 is crucial for response at the global,
national, and local levels. Epidemiological surveillance
information is collected from all countries, territories, and
areas and is made accessible through multiple channels,
including a dynamic dashboard, a daily situation report,
as well as downloadable data extracts.17

Accurate information of COVID‑19 has been communicated
through multiple media channels to provide the right
information, at the right time, to the right audience, so that it
triggers the right action. Unfortunately, the global public health
response to the COVID‑19 pandemic has been accompanied
by an infodemic, which is an over-abundance of information –
some accurate and some not – that makes it hard for people
to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they
need it. This misinformation hampers public health responses
to epidemics and prevents people from taking adequate
measures to effectively prevent disease transmission. Some
misinformation may also lead to dangerous behaviours, such
as self-medication with harmful substances.

There are challenges to conducting global surveillance
includes the lack of a global data architecture that facilitates
the rapid and efficient sharing of data and information from
countries, states, or territories. While the IHR stipulates the
legal responsibilities to inform WHO about the occurrence of
certain public health events, there is currently no harmonized
public health reporting mechanism that enables information
exchange from public health institutes and agencies directly
to WHO. The lack of such a mechanism is a barrier for access
to disaggregated data, which is needed to understand ageand sex-specific epidemiologic features, risk characteristics
of certain sub-groups, and distributions of cases over time
and geographic areas.
The global response to the COVID‑19 pandemic requires
the capacity to conduct ongoing risk assessment at the
global, regional, national, and subnational levels. To fully
leverage the investments and capacities for data collection
and analysis for risk assessment, a new global public health
data architecture will be required.
The foundations of such an architecture have already been
laid through the creation of the Epidemic Intelligence from
Open Sources (EIOS) data platform, which enables multiple
communities of users to collaboratively assess and share
information about outbreak events in real time. The future
vision of the new data architecture has been articulated
by the EPI-BRAIN initiative, which harnesses cutting-edge
tools for big data, crowd sourcing and artificial intelligence
to mitigate the impact of epidemics by allowing stakeholders
to merge public health data with data on the myriad, complex
factors that drive epidemics, including human and animal
population movement, animal diseases, environmental
and meteorological factors, using advances in language
processing and machine learning to provide a more
comprehensive analysis that helps to predict outbreaks
and track their spread.

To manage the infodemic, the communication around
COVID‑19 has been monitored to detect as early as possible
misinformation or gaps in information. Using the WHO
Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN)18 – a close
partnership with various sectors and their respective
members such as faith-based organizations, sporting event
organizers, travel and trade sectors, international employers’
organizations, trade unions organizations, health care delivery
sector and others – existing trusted sources of information
have been amplified and tailored for particular audiences.
This has allowed for the timely corrective action such as
displacing misinformation through a high output of public
health messages that inform individuals and populations how
to protect themselves and support outbreak control activities.
The COVID‑19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly.
This heightens the need for accurate, trusted information
adapted to changing scenarios. Trusted channels of
communication and information through EPI-WIN play
a critical role in meeting information needs.
Through the Global Outbreak and Alert Network (GOARN),19
IFRC, UNICEF, and WHO are coordinating technical and
operational updates on risk communication and humanitarian
partners, with a special focus on highly vulnerable populations,
and the integration of humanitarian partners to support
physical distancing solutions in migrant and camp settings.
Social science and community insights, including perception
surveys and feedback from communities affected by
physical distancing and movement restrictions, are being
rapidly synthesized to ensure that future response measures
are informed by and calibrated according to the ongoing
experiences of affected communities by GOARN research
partners are supporting this effort through the creation
of a repository of risk communication and community
engagement data collection tools (surveys, questionnaires,
rapid assessment methods) to aid researchers and public
health organizations to roll out quick assessments in their
communities of interest.

Coordinated global supply
chain management

Technical expertise and
health emergency workforce

Essential health commodities (including vaccines,
therapeutics and diagnostics) are a global good.
The COVID‑19 pandemic has led to an acute shortage of
essential supplies, including personal protective equipment,
diagnostics, and medical products. The UN has rapidly
convened a Supply Chain Task Force. This task force will,
as an urgent priority, establish a new emergency global
supply chain system (EGSCS) to provide countries with
essential supplies related to COVID‑19 response.

Operational, technical and research networks have all been
activated in the fight against this pandemic. Experts from
around the world and frontline responders are reviewing all
available evidence to develop and update technical guidance
for countries to prepare and respond to COVID‑19. Much
has been learnt about COVID‑19 in the four months since
this outbreak began, but there remain significant knowledge
gaps that must be filled by ongoing surveillance and research
activities. Research protocols to address these gaps have
been rapidly and transparently developed.

The task force will ensure that supply chains are driven
by strategic and tactical health and medical priorities, and
that the most critical gaps in supplies are identified and met
in a timely fashion. This will include a dynamic view of global,
regional, and national demand for infection prevention and
control supplies, personal protective equipment, diagnostic
tests, and clinical support equipment, supplies, therapeutics
and vaccines (when available). A bottom-up assessment
of needs through the COVID‑19 partners portal is being
combined with top-down modelling to provide a robust
forecast of overall needs, and flag areas with urgent
unmet needs, vulnerabilities, and gaps in independent
procurement capacity.
A hub-and-spoke distribution chain will form the basis
of a global logistics distribution chain. The system will include
four strategic international consolidation hubs, including
a sourcing hub in Shanghai and additional international
consolidation hubs in Dubai, Atlanta, and Liege, as well
as six regional staging areas located along primary corridors
serving all countries.
Airlifts will move cargo between international and regional
hubs and onward to countries – these services are a crucial
contribution of the task force given current disruptions to
commercial operators and competing demand. A similar
hub-and-spoke model will be established for passenger
air services where commercial airlines are disrupted, to
ensure that frontline health and humanitarian responders
are operational in priority countries.

The first comprehensive set of technical guidance20 was
published on 10 January 2020, and is being constantly
reviewed and revised based on available evidence.
Technical guidance is being adapted for different settings
and contexts based on the intensity of transmission, the
capacity of countries to implement public health measures,
and available resources, and translate key actions required
for countries through the EPI-WIN platform and other
information products. 1.2 million people have enrolled in
the OpenWHO training platform which has COVID‑19-specific
courses available in 43 languages.
Direct technical assistance to Member States is also
facilitated through GOARN which has made 209 offers
of technical support. Experts have been deployed from
27 partner institutions and technical networks to provide
support to countries directly and by remote assistance.
GOARN colleagues from UNICEF, IFRC, US CDC, and OCHA
are embedded in the global COVID‑19 incident management
team and are supporting all pillars of response.
Access to emergency health workforce capacity
is coordinated through the over 100 Emergency Medical
Teams (EMTs)21 and focal points worldwide, who are working
closely with the EMT secretariat to continuously monitor,
guide, and facilitate national and international COVID‑19
response operations.
The EMT secretariat is involved in intensive discussions
to strengthen capacity and support to countries in Africa.
In addition, EMTs worldwide are identifying technical experts
and coordinators who can support integrated public health
and clinical teams.
In addition, the Global Health Cluster (GHC)22 continues
to support Health Clusters in 29 countries to implement
the COVID‑19 GHRP to respond and preserve existing
humanitarian health action and commitments in line
with the GHRP 2020.

COVID-19 STRATEGY UPDATE

Accelerating research, innovation,
and knowledge sharing
On 11 and 12 February 2020, the Global Research Forum,
hosted by WHO in Geneva, developed an initial COVID‑19
Global Research Roadmap to guide a united COVID‑19
agenda for research and development.23 The forum was
unanimous that there is an urgent need to research and
develop medical countermeasures, including vaccines,
therapeutics, and diagnostics.
Important investments are already funding many efforts and
activities to address the challenge of COVID‑19. A report on
the landscape of global research efforts on vaccines is issued
weekly and provides updates on the progress of research
and innovation efforts including the stages of advancement
of candidate vaccines, two of which are currently in clinical
evaluation phase. There are already areas of targeted
coordination and funding such as CEPI for vaccines and the
WHO Solidarity Trial for therapeutics, which is a trial testing
potential old and new therapies to fight COVID‑19. Many
other efforts are also being independently organized and
financed. For maximum impact, the global community will
require a truly unified and international effort. Acting now
requires the public and private sectors to come together
in support of a transparent and coordinated global process
to pursue research and innovation priorities for collective
action around this common global threat.
A global COVID‑19 accelerated vaccine venture has been
established to coordinate an unprecedented partnership of
stakeholders with WHO that is needed to align the ecosystem
around a dedicated vaccine master plan and uncover every
opportunity to maximize speed of innovation and scale
of delivery. Within the context of the broader Research
and Innovation Action Plan, this special initiative drives
the unique targeting and intense global focus to achieve
mass immunization from COVID‑19 at breakneck speed.
Building and expanding on the Global Research Roadmap,
WHO is working with partners to develop a framework
for coordinated research and innovation and an overview
of the scale of investments required for financing. Enabling
the greatest global good will require solidarity and
collaboration, establishing sufficiently funded, collaborative,
cross-agency and public-private partnerships, and facilitating
open data access and information sharing. Support and
investment will be necessary across public, private and
philanthropic sectors along with prioritization and proper
stewardship of those resources.

Coordination and the combination of efforts will be critical
to collective success. Individual and isolated action, however
dedicated and determined, will not be sufficient to meet the
current challenge of COVID‑19. In order to be successful
we will need to pool, build, and pass innovation from
strength to strength. This will require proactive and
intentioned coordination rather than more passive monitoring
and reporting of activities.
A concerted and ongoing effort will be required to ensure
coordination across stakeholders. Convening, coordination
and benefit sharing will be critical to ensure that all
stakeholders are appropriately engaged. Data, virus and
technology sharing arrangements can facilitate expedited
discovery and early development efforts while also creating
a foundation for longer-term research and development
beyond the current outbreak. Tactically, aligning on
common protocols and standards, priority setting, and
the development of target product profiles will be important
to ensure that innovation flows seamlessly from one stage
to the next, while simultaneously ensuring key milestones
for decision making are understood and downstream
development and delivery vehicles are proactively prepared.
To facilitate this, resource mobilization and investment
prioritization as well as monitoring and oversight will
be required and are underway.
Given the differences in research platforms, development
processes, timelines, key players, and coordination
considerations for vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics,
a set of detailed action plans for each countermeasure
is under rapid development.

Strengthening pandemic
preparedness for the future
With the world facing an unprecedented threat, there
is an opportunity to emerge with stronger health systems,
and improved global collaboration to face the next health
threat. As we focus on the immediate response to the
